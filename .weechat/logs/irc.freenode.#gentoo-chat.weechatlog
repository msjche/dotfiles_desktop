2015-03-08 10:57:23	mvaenskae	i always left out -j8; maybe that's why it took my kernel so "long" on my xeon :)
2015-03-08 10:58:04	+wiktor_b	yup, and if you have lots of ram, -j can be nice

2015-03-08 10:59:17	mvaenskae	-j -l8 sets the loads to max 8 by spawning as many jobs as there is space for them? :)
2015-03-08 10:59:36	+wiktor_b	it's a bit simpler than that, actually
2015-03-08 10:59:57	+wiktor_b	it'll keep spawning jobs unless load is >=8
2015-03-08 11:00:46	+wiktor_b	it does mean your load will probably shoot through the roof for the first few seconds, but it should drop fairly quickly

2015-03-08 15:52:54	dugz	GrizLT, its not so much thats as that I really dislike how Grub2 goes about things, and legacy grub seems like a dead end. So I'm giving extlinux a whirl. I want to be the only one modifying my boot menus, not metafiles that are parsed by robots

2015-03-18 23:26:58	redcheckers	dugz well. college might help me get a better future since working with people who wouldn't want to see me as anything but a college degree means a better future
2015-03-18 23:27:19	dugz	agreed
2015-03-18 23:27:29	redcheckers	dugz but it feels like a waste of time since the undergrad courses are slow paced and too simple to complete
2015-03-18 23:27:44	redcheckers	and it also uses some money.
2015-03-18 23:27:50	dugz	switch to engineering then
2015-03-18 23:27:57	redcheckers	I started out as mech d
2015-03-18 23:28:00	redcheckers	e
2015-03-18 23:28:42	redcheckers	dugz I can read textbooks well enough without a course... so I got lots of useless knowledge to build on
2015-03-18 23:28:56	dugz	thats what my degree is
2015-03-18 23:29:09	redcheckers	dugz but if I then have to take courses that give less than a well made PowerPoint presentation ...
2015-03-18 23:29:58	redcheckers	I just wonder if its worth continuining on in since I won't get any real recognition of the degree when it comes to the field, published papers are more important.
2015-03-18 23:30:22	dugz	powerpoints are an incremental improvement over those damn transparencies and overhead projector at least. they put me to sleep though
2015-03-18 23:30:44	redcheckers	so I am taking  courses and not learning... spending time, tax money, and without any intrinsic value to the degree
2015-03-18 23:30:57	redcheckers	well, at least the projector hummed
2015-03-18 23:31:42	dugz	doing the coursework and taking the tests helps reinforce the knowledge though, and it tends to show you what is important vs trivial whereas reading the textbook might not be so clear cut
2015-03-18 23:32:00	redcheckers	shrug. I preferred just memorizing the whole thing
2015-03-18 23:32:11	redcheckers	it takes less time than worrying over what is trivial
2015-03-18 23:32:42	dugz	hey if you can do that, then just drop out, memorize the library, and go seek your fortune then
2015-03-18 23:32:47	redcheckers	and no, taking the tests, at least in undergrad is not reinforcing anything except how many of my classmates used Google for their homework
2015-03-18 23:34:01	redcheckers	dugz I really did read through the public library in a small city when I was younger. I skipped a lot of the young adult section since it was mostly just like the romance novels at the supermarket
2015-03-18 23:34:34	dugz	i found that junior and senior level courses had a significant ramp up of challenge, much to my dismay
2015-03-18 23:34:36	redcheckers	dugz but go and seek your fortune is such a fickle thing. college doesn't teach people how to seek a fortune
2015-03-18 23:35:01	redcheckers	dugz yes I expect as much ... instead of grad students , maybe actual professors teaching too
2015-03-18 23:35:06	dugz	it all depends what you are taking. college is what you make of it.
2015-03-18 23:35:23	redcheckers	but not being able to take upper division courses that look interesting until post grad is sooo annoying
2015-03-18 23:35:30	dugz	grad students do suck as teachers, i agree there
2015-03-18 23:36:37	redcheckers	well. the thing is... my current field is russian studies. and most of the material related to that in coursework is very specific , timelines, constitutions, imperial territories etc
2015-03-18 23:37:20	redcheckers	and the actual professional usefulness of such things requires getting hired somewhere that will most likely teach you what they want done anyways.
2015-03-18 23:37:29	dugz	ahh a liberal arts major. after you graduate you can juggle bowling balls at the renaissance fairs
2015-03-18 23:38:01	redcheckers	dugz so if I could see a path to getting hired in field and so on... and on the job training or internships etc it would be a better use of my time
2015-03-18 23:38:11	dugz	why aren't you taking comp sci?
2015-03-18 23:38:17	redcheckers	the degree is just a doorjam x.x a 46,000 tax dollar etc doorjam
2015-03-18 23:38:41	dugz	then go to a cheaper school
2015-03-18 23:38:42	redcheckers	dugz cause all the good comp sci jobs are outsourced IMHO ... and all the money is in having your own company
2015-03-18 23:39:25	redcheckers	dugz there aren't many cheaper schools unless I move , then lose most my credits that don't transfer, and then wait for the va to get caught up on the certifications etc. besides. its tax dollars
2015-03-18 23:40:05	redcheckers	dugz anyhow I can already juggle the smaller bowling balls
2015-03-18 23:40:08	dugz	all i can suggest, is study something that you like doing
2015-03-18 23:40:30	dugz	that way you will get extra benefit from the education
2015-03-18 23:41:06	redcheckers	dugz I like Akkadian language , optometry, optics, material science, aerodynamics, architecture, and women with accents
2015-03-18 23:41:09	 *	dugz is sipping on a glass of absinthe
2015-03-18 23:41:20	redcheckers	ooo how chocolaty
2015-03-18 23:41:47	dugz	materials science is pretty cools stuff, metallurgy, crystals, composites ...
2015-03-18 23:41:55	redcheckers	its fun.
2015-03-18 23:42:05	dugz	i liked the courses that i took in it
2015-03-18 23:42:07	redcheckers	but if you don't go into a PhD program...
2015-03-18 23:42:35	redcheckers	the job descriptions basically look like lab tech / grunt for the PhD with the cool job and the credit on papers published
2015-03-18 23:42:45	+DrEeevil	yup
2015-03-18 23:42:46	dugz	nah you could get a job in a foundry analyzing samples of the batches for good money, easy work, thats just one application
2015-03-18 23:42:55	redcheckers	and I could get a better labtech grunt job in a trade school I bet
2015-03-18 23:43:08	+DrEeevil	redcheckers: it's not about that job
2015-03-18 23:43:16	redcheckers	oh?
2015-03-18 23:43:18	+DrEeevil	you trade that work for a shiny piece of paper, effectively
2015-03-18 23:43:35	redcheckers	a shiny piece of paper sounds nice
2015-03-18 23:43:44	redcheckers	how luminescent would it be?
2015-03-18 23:43:57	redcheckers	and can I fold it like origami?
2015-03-18 23:44:03	dugz	depends on how much you put into it
2015-03-18 23:44:36	dugz	engineers for instance rarely go beyond an undergrad degree
2015-03-18 23:45:08	dugz	if you go for graduate engineering, its because you want to teach engineering
2015-03-18 23:45:19	redcheckers	most the engineers I have two bachelors or a masters
2015-03-18 23:45:28	redcheckers	I know have *
2015-03-18 23:45:49	redcheckers	usually math or physics or bus management with engineering
2015-03-18 23:46:19	dugz	well, pursing an MBA is something engineers do once they are working fairly often
2015-03-18 23:46:52	redcheckers	dugz I understand math and science in concept fairly well... and I have a fairly good vocabulary in a few languages. it is just tedious to study the same things I studied in h.s. again with drunk and stoned college students who don't want to be there
2015-03-18 23:46:54	dugz	it depends if they want to be an engineer or a manager
2015-03-18 23:48:01	dugz	redcheckers, put them to shame then, bust the curve. tell them to pay up or you will make them all fail :evil:

2015-03-18 23:55:28	dugz	redcheckers, does it contain the thujone?
2015-03-18 23:55:32	redcheckers	right. or they develop a process then get canned
2015-03-18 23:55:55	redcheckers	dugz it didn't list thujone on the label. is that something required to be labelled in Ukraine?
2015-03-18 23:56:18	dugz	idk. is absinthe legal?
2015-03-18 23:56:26	redcheckers	I didn't notice any anise in it sadly
2015-03-18 23:56:35	redcheckers	dunno? if they sell it it must be legal
2015-03-18 23:57:02	dugz	absinthe is all about the thujone, otherwise its just like strong ouzo that you mix with sugar and water
2015-03-18 23:57:21	redcheckers	and anise
2015-03-18 23:57:33	dugz	thats just to mask the nasty wormwood flavor

2015-03-19 00:04:10	dugz	no my bank is pretty good. good security on their website, great service, nearby locations, good hours, minimal fees.
2015-03-19 00:04:19	redcheckers	for now.
2015-03-19 00:04:27	redcheckers	wait til something goes wrong.
2015-03-19 00:04:40	dugz	its been that way for years, i'll jump ship if they screw me
2015-03-19 00:04:48	redcheckers	ditto
2015-03-19 00:05:09	redcheckers	I do wish they would be a bit more alarmed when notified of the check fraud
2015-03-19 00:05:26	redcheckers	instead of telling me oh I see this all the time its probably just a transposed number
2015-03-19 00:06:45	redcheckers	dugz but after a bit of effort, and contacting the manager at that Walmart while the other manager is on vacation
2015-03-19 00:06:47	dugz	i can pull up a PDF of every one of my checks that has been cashed online.
2015-03-19 00:07:00	redcheckers	I am told they still have the videos from the security cameras
2015-03-19 00:07:20	redcheckers	dugz that sounds nice. all I can do is get the ACH details of online checks
2015-03-19 00:07:22	dugz	is your balance off?
2015-03-19 00:08:06	redcheckers	nope they credited it back to me, again, after going in, waiting for a service rep, filling out forms for almost an hour and ahalf, and then waiting for it to process it came back in later today
2015-03-19 00:08:24	redcheckers	twice in three weeks. oh its probably just a transposed number.
2015-03-19 00:09:20	dugz	tell them you want a new account number or you'll close your account?
2015-03-19 00:09:36	redcheckers	dugz first time they paid an electric bill. second time they shopped at Walmart.    both of those seem to me, as a non law enforcement personnel type regular citizen, like the sort of things that could leave a bit of a trail if the police ever bother with it
2015-03-19 00:10:49	dugz	just close your account then.
2015-03-19 00:11:04	redcheckers	dugz if I close my account my direct deposit will be all sorts of late ... but that aside, after the second time in two weeks, and a lengthy speakerphone chat with their ACH person and their ACH person staying on hold with me to call the power company in questions representative who called me back after I finally contacted their CEO 's home and spoke to his wife yesterday, I got a new
2015-03-19 00:11:23	redcheckers	number of some kind that goes on the checks, which will supposedly help
2015-03-19 00:11:34	dugz	ok, open a new account somewhere else, switch your direct deposit over, and when it changes, then close the old one
2015-03-19 00:11:47	redcheckers	right. that's what I need to look at.
2015-03-19 00:12:30	dugz	a lot of banks will give you preferred accounts if you have a direct deposit happening
2015-03-19 00:12:33	redcheckers	but if it turns out to be someone I know, I am wondering just how to react. maybe stop trusting people as much. in a sense a total stranger being the criminal might be better
2015-03-19 00:12:55	redcheckers	dugz nod, I worry more about foreign transaction fees then most other services though
2015-03-19 00:13:07	dugz	it could be an addict, they do stupid things like that even though they will probably get busted
2015-03-19 00:13:49	redcheckers	or it could be that dishonest guy at the car dealership who offered to guarantee me a better rate and fix my credit application for a thousand dollars cash
2015-03-19 00:14:09	dugz	occam's razor
2015-03-19 00:14:13	redcheckers	or it could be someone at the strip club I frequent if a check fell out of my wallet at some point
2015-03-19 00:14:30	redcheckers	or it could be someone from my hotel that had access to the room
2015-03-19 00:14:40	redcheckers	but that is the end of the list

2015-03-19 00:20:07	redcheckers	so three places got checks from me. once came back as a scan from my online banking, one got destroyed after it was entered into the insurance company system, and the other was paper clipped in a stack of auto loan paperwork
2015-03-19 00:20:22	redcheckers	dugz so like you said about that razor...
2015-03-19 00:21:08	redcheckers	but I have to lend some weight to the possibility of cleaning and maintenance guys at the hotel, or the possibility of simply losing a check while at a bar
2015-03-19 00:21:11	+DrEeevil	so 1970s :)
2015-03-19 00:21:40	redcheckers	just like my shirt.

2015-03-19 00:24:22	dugz	i have this Ukrainian greatcoat from like WWI, thick wool felt, fur lining, leather shoulders and back. it weighs about 30 pounds
2015-03-19 00:24:37	dugz	looks amazingly steampunk
2015-03-19 00:24:43	redcheckers	cool! I have a Ukrainian made greatcoat from the 1980s
2015-03-19 00:25:28	dugz	judging by the one i have, it must get mighty cold there
2015-03-19 00:25:50	redcheckers	not sure. mine is a different style worn as part of the parade uniform
2015-03-19 00:26:26	redcheckers	dugz did you see that recent north Korea movie with the handshakes and Katy perry song?
2015-03-19 00:26:39	redcheckers	mine looks more like the jackets they wore in that movie

2015-03-19 00:31:08	dugz	mine lacks the tabs and piping, but its double-breasted and has huge cuffs
2015-03-19 00:31:28	redcheckers	I know a guy at an export company that can probably find you the tabs
2015-03-19 00:31:49	dugz	nah, if anything i would put steampunk fantasy insignia on it

2015-06-17 08:37:08	hosler	spacedust: just remove 127.0.0.1 from the distcc list
2015-06-17 08:37:31	spacedust	hosler: i dont have 127 there i have only one ip with a port
2015-06-17 08:37:45	mvaenskae	spacedust: if you get significantly quicker compile times please tell me
2015-06-17 08:37:54	spacedust	hosler: and i started distcc on that ip like this: distccd --verbose --no-detach --log-stderr --allow 192.168.3.0/24 --port 11453
2015-06-17 08:37:55	hosler	then it shouldnt compile locally unless it fails to push stuff to the nodes
2015-06-17 08:38:04	spacedust	mvaenskae: compared to what ?
2015-06-17 08:38:08	mvaenskae	locally
2015-06-17 08:38:26	spacedust	mvaenskae: well its a arm device, i dont want to push it :) rather use distcc nodes
2015-06-17 08:38:43	spacedust	hosler: can i use MAKEOPTS="-j4 -l0" ?
2015-06-17 08:38:49	hosler	go for it
2015-06-17 08:39:03	spacedust	hosler: also i dont understand i why does the guide says to multiple the -jN by two ?
2015-06-17 08:39:16	hosler	dunno
2015-06-17 08:39:19	spacedust	example : # total number of cores is 10, so N = 2*10+1 and M=2
2015-06-17 08:39:21	hosler	i do number for cores +1
2015-06-17 08:39:56	spacedust	hosler: i had makeopts -j2 only before and i saw some text on the distcc box output but i also saw some compiling on the local box
2015-06-17 08:39:59	spacedust	make -j2 ....
2015-06-17 08:40:07	spacedust	so im not sure which one is doing the actual work :)

2015-06-17 08:40:56	hosler	all this is in the pi distcc wiki guide for gentoo
2015-06-17 08:41:07	spacedust	hosler: i dont use distcc as the guide says
2015-06-17 08:41:15	hosler	ummm
2015-06-17 08:41:15	spacedust	i started it manually with that command above
2015-06-17 08:41:33	hosler	if you are trying to use distcc i suggest using distcc
2015-06-17 08:41:42	spacedust	great now i get this :  * Please ensure that /dev/shm is mounted as a tmpfs with mode 1777.
2015-06-17 08:42:09	spacedust	bohh i dont have no /dev/shm
2015-06-17 08:42:11	spacedust	great
2015-06-17 08:42:59	spacedust	how is that possible ?
2015-06-17 08:43:15	+iamben	spacedust: on a chroot or main host?
2015-06-17 08:43:59	spacedust	iamben: i dont have it on neither , i used mount --rbind /dev
2015-06-17 08:44:26	spacedust	iamben: i also lacked /dev/fd which i lninked from /proc/self/fd
2015-06-17 08:45:19	spacedust	can i mount -t tmpfs -o rw,defaults /dev/shm ?
2015-06-17 08:45:58	soloslinger	If I have a command, "modprobe nbd max_part=xx"  is the max_part a parameter passed to the kernel module nbd?  Where would I find a man page describing those parameters?

2015-06-17 10:09:08	spacedust	so you are not using a chroot cause distcc wouldnt start ? :))

2015-06-17 10:11:56	mystica555	and not TLC like the newer ones

2015-06-17 10:12:34	slicktux	ill check
2015-06-17 10:12:41	mystica555	i think 840 was never slc
2015-06-17 10:12:45	mystica555	but was good quality mlc
2015-06-17 10:12:50	mystica555	i might be wrong on that

2015-06-17 10:13:16	Smiley	I need to poke that more later.
2015-06-17 10:13:18	slicktux	if it is not slc, then I do not  know why it would cost more than the 850 (which is newer).
2015-06-17 10:13:20	Smiley	awaaaay!!
2015-06-17 10:13:21	CcxCZ	I don't think SLCs were ever used for "high" capacities.

2015-06-17 10:15:11	mystica555	slicktux: 840Pro is now legacy; theres less quantity available. 850Pro uses 3d-nand tech, and apparently is cheaper to manufacture, or the economies of scale are catching up with pricing

2015-06-17 10:34:11	Smiley	crossdev will automatically place the ebuilds/categories it generates into the highest priority overlay found in /etc/portage/repos.conf/. Most users will want to prevent crossdev from disturbing layman's overlays or the user's personal per-machine overlay (normally created at /usr/local/portage).

2015-06-17 11:46:57	+iamben	the difference between 5W and 20W is mostly meaningless, but the difference between 20W and 100W starts to matter, that's all i was really getting at
2015-06-17 11:47:18	inode33	Alright
2015-06-17 11:47:27	inode33	Then that's what I'll get once this one fails.
2015-06-17 11:47:30	catpiggest	iamben, 15W 24/7 means 26€ at 20ct/kWh for a year
2015-06-17 11:47:32	+iamben	and by going for the pi you take a HUGE performance loss for those last few watts, you do save some hw cost too i suppose
2015-06-17 11:47:35	catpiggest	which is enough to buy a second pi

2015-06-17 12:18:17	dawid	i may be wrong, but my gues s would be that youd have to use very unsafe NFS settings to get proper performance
2015-06-17 12:18:24	spacedust	lejonet: would be nice to implement some zfs just so it doesnt bores out of complexity :)))
2015-06-17 12:18:29	+lejonet	spacedust: You might want to fiddle a bit with the mount options for NFS in this case, like rsize and wsize and such
2015-06-17 12:18:36	+lejonet	spacedust: hahaha

2015-06-17 13:18:45	robink	and the aim is to have it supported in Gecko/Firefox, WebKit/Blink/Chrome/Chromium/Safari/Opera, and Edge (will replace/become IE 12.0)
2015-06-17 13:19:02	inode33	What's the point?
2015-06-17 13:19:11	inode33	Why not use java if you're going to do something like that?
2015-06-17 13:20:14	daniel2	So, you guys all run Gentoo on your servers?
2015-06-17 13:20:32	robink	inode33: because this will be optimized for hooking into standard JS, the DOM, and the underlying browser support code.
2015-06-17 13:20:36	robink	daniel2: Yep
2015-06-17 13:20:43	robink	daniel2: Trying to get a Gentoo GCE instance up and running as well.
2015-06-17 13:20:52	daniel2	GCE?
2015-06-17 13:20:55	robink	inode33: and it'll likely be faster than Java

2015-06-17 13:21:15	daniel2	I am upgrading my dedicated, so it requires a reinstall as it's a new server, they provide a Gentoo image.
2015-06-17 13:21:16	robink	inode33: Plus it'll be able to target everything that LLVM does (with official upstream support, unlike Emscripen)
2015-06-17 13:21:19	daniel2	I am debating on using it.
2015-06-17 13:21:24	daniel2	I might stick to CentOS though
2015-06-17 13:21:47	inode33	Faster than java?
2015-06-17 13:22:25	inode33	Erm I thought oracle put a lot of effort into optimizing that already.

2015-06-17 17:16:58	jerichowasahoax	there's no way that 40GB recovery partition contains *just* windows recovery stuff
2015-06-17 17:17:07	inode33	I was wrong it's just 21GB
2015-06-17 17:17:13	jerichowasahoax	not if you can fit the whole OS on a single DVD
2015-06-17 17:17:16	inode33	That's still crap compression/bloatware
2015-06-17 17:17:27	inode33	Considering windows 8 fits on a single dvd :)
2015-06-17 17:17:59	inode33	I should roll my own recovery partition.
2015-06-17 17:18:14	jerichowasahoax	see this is why if i bump into an OEM Windows install, even if I intend for it to be a Windows system, I just wipe the drive clean and install the OS myself
2015-06-17 17:18:32	inode33	I have a retail windows key.
2015-06-17 17:18:49	inode33	So I don't have to deal with OEM crap most of the time.
2015-06-17 17:19:10	inode33	but a lean mean gentoo install
2015-06-17 17:19:14	inode33	would be sweet
2015-06-17 17:19:42	inode33	X is at the point now where I would trust my system to it (no keyboard on the tablet)
2015-06-17 17:19:51	inode33	A couple years ago I never would have done that.

2015-06-17 17:22:45	inode33	No I just mean bad intel/radeon drivers of the past.
2015-06-17 17:23:18	inode33	Might be wiser to go with android, considering the software ecosystem, I don't know.
2015-06-17 17:23:50	+iamben	if you go with a bloated/modern DE then it'll probably work well
2015-06-17 17:24:11	jerichowasahoax	haven't had issues with intel ever, not even on my old Compaq from WinVista days, but then again i don't think I ever pushed that computer that hard
2015-06-17 17:24:58	inode33	I had problems with intel 945 cards in normal use.
2015-06-17 17:25:10	inode33	my laptop would crash at arbitrary times.
2015-06-17 17:25:22	inode33	It was pretty bad because I'd lose my desktop session.
2015-06-17 17:25:34	inode33	I need to set up xpra or something to stop that.
2015-06-17 17:25:36	jerichowasahoax	that might be why, i don't think that computer had a 945
2015-06-17 17:26:20	+iamben	were you using a 945 when it was "current gen" like 10 years ago, or recently? =)
2015-06-17 17:26:36	jerichowasahoax	*this* one might, but if intel drivers radically improved since then that's not exactly a comparison :V
2015-06-17 17:27:13	inode33	I was using them from 10 years ago to 4 years ago.
2015-06-17 17:27:16	inode33	So yeah
2015-06-17 17:27:45	inode33	Newer intel cards shouldn't have that problem though right?
2015-06-17 17:27:51	inode33	They published the programmer's manual.
2015-06-17 17:28:04	+iamben	there are occasional bugs but in general pretty stable

2015-06-24 21:57:35	_anomaly_	you can add one for pause, but it's not necessary for grammar

2015-06-24 22:01:28	_anomaly_	this is also a corner case and possibly acceptible though it reads ugly:  Four years ago my plans for my future differed; from what I am doing today.

2015-06-28 21:13:56	neodragon	been toying with the idea for a bit, to switch to KDE. I normally use XFCE4 + Compiz but, the version of Compiz in the main portage repo is really out dated and no one has updated it to the latest 0.9.12.
2015-06-28 21:14:36	neodragon	KDE on the other hand has all the Compiz features build directly into it now
2015-06-28 21:14:50	neodragon	which is why I was thinking of switching
2015-06-28 21:15:10	+xiaomiao	people *still* use compiz?!
2015-06-28 21:15:15	+xiaomiao	intestine blown ...
2015-06-28 21:15:25	neodragon	some of us do, yes
2015-06-28 21:16:11	neodragon	but, it's now being maintained by the Canonical because Unity is nothing more than a giant Compiz plugin
2015-06-28 21:16:41	neodragon	so it's still in active developement
2015-06-28 21:18:43	neodragon	many of the eye candy features are still unmatched by any DE other than KDE
2015-06-28 21:19:28	neodragon	plus the latest version, 0.9.12 now supports gtk3
2015-06-28 21:19:30	_anomaly_	xiaomiao: after basically unmerging eeeeeverything besides what comes in the stage3 tarball and installing fresh on ~amd64, plasma5's been ok

2015-06-28 21:19:46	_anomaly_	and missing apps/applets

2015-06-28 21:21:02	neodragon	So is it worth installing KDE5 then?
2015-06-28 21:21:37	+xiaomiao	neodragon: try it and see
2015-06-28 21:21:45	neodragon	or should I say Plasma/KDE5

2015-06-28 21:25:17	neodragon	technically KF5 is short for KDE Framework 5
2015-06-28 21:25:32	neodragon	so there is a KDE5
2015-06-28 21:25:41	neodragon	or kde5
2015-06-28 21:25:42	+xiaomiao	is that KDE or just K ? ;)

2015-06-28 22:53:32	_anomaly_	they also claim to have invented bum sex.  no one is disputing that though
2015-06-28 22:53:36	_anomaly_	they can have that claim

2015-06-28 22:53:53	_genuser_	using? as in?
2015-06-28 22:53:58	+xiaomiao	"fiscal responsibility" = sell off the airport for 1/10th of its value?
2015-06-28 22:54:10	+xiaomiao	and the economy has already contracted >30%
2015-06-28 22:54:18	+xiaomiao	unemployment has more than doubled
2015-06-28 22:54:27	+xiaomiao	what's a threat of "it could get worse" then?

2015-06-28 22:54:53	snappahead	put people in jail
2015-06-28 22:54:54	_genuser_	employment has doubled is meaningless.

2015-06-28 22:55:06	_genuser_	double could mean from 1% to 2% or 10% to 20%
2015-06-28 22:55:15	snappahead	the brits and europeans tole them it would be armageddon

2015-06-28 22:59:48	_genuser_	fiscal responsibility means being responsible financially. If you're using another political description, that's on you.
2015-06-28 23:00:02	+xiaomiao	that's amazing
2015-06-28 23:00:07	_genuser_	according to you, it means "no chance of recovery". that's harsh and I haven't implied that at all.

2015-06-28 23:00:33	+xiaomiao	in this specific context you can't use a specific word carelessly
2015-06-28 23:00:43	_genuser_	you assumed that I meant that. I'm sure people who have an opposing viewpoint that yours have been in teh news using the same words and you're equating my position with theirs.

2015-07-02 13:19:39	hosler	what is it
2015-07-02 13:19:47	Smiley	k, so i want to build a php page, which will execute some commands, which will do some things on my pi
2015-07-02 13:19:53	Smiley	the pages themselves won't be hosted on the pi
2015-07-02 13:19:57	Smiley	what's the 'best way'
2015-07-02 13:20:12	hosler	Smiley: ssh
2015-07-02 13:20:16	hosler	or php API
2015-07-02 13:20:25	hosler	API would be easiest i think
2015-07-02 13:20:28	Smiley	thttps://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion/wiki/software-architecture
2015-07-02 13:20:31	Smiley	API?
2015-07-02 13:20:34	hosler	yeah
2015-07-02 13:20:49	Smiley	Write a 'listener' on the pi?
2015-07-02 13:20:50	hosler	send HTTP POST requests to pi from another page

2015-07-02 13:21:47	hosler	so it would be outside--->webserver---->weberserver(on pi)
2015-07-02 13:21:54	Smiley	Could be
2015-07-02 13:22:00	hosler	i mean that's how i would do it
2015-07-02 13:22:12	hosler	have the pi have a php page that listens for API calls
2015-07-02 13:23:03	hosler	or dont use php on pi and write a socket app to look for API calls

2015-07-02 13:48:46	+iamben	well, when doing "editing" versus chruning out new code, anyway

2015-07-02 13:49:14	nrem	though i will say this, vim's regex's are annoying.
2015-07-02 13:49:26	+igli	mostly i want to type code, only occasionally do i need to bulk-replace etc with a regex
2015-07-02 13:49:45	+igli	and i prefer ed for that, via eed wrapper
2015-07-02 13:49:58	 *	nrem sticks out his tongue
2015-07-02 13:50:04	+iamben	well lots of other stuff happens in command mode, especially navigation
2015-07-02 13:50:16	nrem	iamben: we said vim not vi ;)
2015-07-02 13:50:34	+iamben	i dont understand what that means

2015-07-02 13:51:01	+igli	++
2015-07-02 13:51:22	+iamben	yeah but when your file is hundreds or thousands of lines, that's not too efficient
2015-07-02 13:51:38	+igli	ex is nice, but hassle for portability
2015-07-02 13:51:52	nrem	mm, yeah iamben
2015-07-02 13:52:00	+igli	(ie: vi in non-interactive mode.)
2015-07-02 13:52:10	nrem	but you don't usually have to jump around files too terribly much when you're coding something originally.

2015-07-02 13:52:30	 *	igli loves kate
2015-07-02 13:52:50	+igli	yeah pgup/dn are important
2015-07-02 13:52:52	+iamben	yes, if you are just churning out NEW code, you will spend a lot more time in insert mode.  obviously.
2015-07-02 13:53:12	+igli	nano is nice in terminal for new code; forces you to be terse ;)
2015-07-02 13:53:29	+igli	it's so crappy, you become much more concise heh
2015-07-02 13:54:14	+igli	much cleaner code when you open it in kate to integrate it
2015-07-02 13:55:00	+iamben	true
2015-07-02 13:55:39	+igli	plus it's easy to blat stuff around in terminal with ed first, for things like makefiles

2015-07-02 15:09:53	slicktux	doc235: well, Somone special that i've not seen for over four years came to 'visit' me at my old place (mom, sisters live there) and well. I'm mad that I was not there and also mad because I'm sure my paternalistic sister gave her the cold shoulder. That is why my life is pitiful at the moment. Simply put, I wish I was not so heart felt about the situtation...
2015-07-02 15:11:01	slicktux	And yes, she 'did not' leave a number and she, as well as I, does not have a social media account. We are both hard to get in touch with...

2015-07-03 12:11:31	Smiley	and i'm home
2015-07-03 12:11:40	robink	So if the display goes to sleep on the current Xorg server build, the cursor disappears when it wakes up
2015-07-03 12:11:51	robink	and the only way to get it back is to do the VT switch thing (change to a non-X VT, switch back)
2015-07-03 12:12:11	+iamben	im ready for home.  this is the 4th time i've downloaded this stupid ios update today, im 95% sure it's gonna fail again but i need closure on this
2015-07-03 12:12:13	robink	but of course I'm on the AMDGPU driver and literally running Git master everything
2015-07-03 12:12:34	+iamben	robink: did it just break or it's been like that since you started using AMDGPU?
2015-07-03 12:12:36	Smiley	iamben: you cna get closure by launching the thing outta the window at high velocity
2015-07-03 12:12:44	+iamben	that will be the next step if this fails
2015-07-03 12:12:46	Smiley	Now, why has my hibernate/suspend buttons been greyed out
2015-07-03 12:12:56	Smiley	it's to do with the pm-optisohtings things I was dealing wiht yesterday I susspect.
2015-07-03 12:13:05	robink	iamben: It just broke.

2015-07-03 12:13:13	+iamben	robink: git bisect time
2015-07-03 12:13:29	robink	iamben: Ironically some of the recent commits to the forked libdrm and the xf86-video-amdgpu driver were to purportedly fix a disappearing cursor problem
2015-07-03 12:16:04	robink	iamben: at least I thought so
2015-07-03 12:16:21	robink	iamben: I'm going through the commit logs and I haven't found the "cursor fix" commit.  Maybe I hallucinated it.
2015-07-03 12:16:40	+iamben	i think you briefly saw into the future
2015-07-03 12:16:45	robink	iamben: haha
2015-07-03 12:16:58	robink	iamben: It's too bad my git client didn't also see into the future, otherwise I'd have the fix.
2015-07-03 12:17:01	+iamben	today you will git bisect the issue, tomorrow you report it, then sunday it gets fixed
2015-07-03 12:17:07	robink	iamben: heh
2015-07-03 12:17:08	+iamben	and sunday is what you saw

2015-07-03 12:25:49	Smiley	Me too :D
2015-07-03 12:26:26	+iamben	the pm-utils code was cut out of upower, and MOST applications ahve been updated for the change, but if you use something that still needs that older code (i suspect xfce4 is an example) then you need to get upower-pm-utils which adds that code back in
2015-07-03 12:31:13	Smiley	oh right cool

2015-07-03 12:39:15	Smiley	or you can do what I do and fill it with whatever you find, if it's going to be covered...
2015-07-03 12:39:18	Smiley	Hahah dear lord
2015-07-03 12:39:22	+iamben	polyfilla sounds gangsta
2015-07-03 12:39:25	+BCMM	you put the pollyfilla in the hole, and then you wait for it to dry, and then you sand it so it's smooth
2015-07-03 12:39:34	Smiley	I had some ultra strong instant glue stuff (like no more nails)
2015-07-03 12:39:43	 *	eroen googles polyfilla
2015-07-03 12:39:45	+BCMM	and then hopefully you can't see there was a hole there
2015-07-03 12:39:51	Smiley	used that to fill the hole where the blind is hung in 2.0's room, it's now rock solid after taking about a week to dry ;D
2015-07-03 12:40:12	+BCMM	i assume there is some plaster or something over the concrete? or are you really just painting concrete?
2015-07-03 12:40:22	eroen	ephemer0l: One of my concerns is whether I can just paint over spacle?
2015-07-03 12:40:28	eroen	after sanding, ofc
2015-07-03 12:40:45	ephemer0l	eroen: yeah, just wait till it's dry, or else the paint might bubble.

2015-07-07 20:56:00	_anomaly_	they are

2015-07-07 20:56:20	+bonsaikitten	there's been lots of trouble lately with TRIM, and there were slowdowns when data wasn't read often enough
2015-07-07 20:56:22	_anomaly_	yes

2015-07-07 20:57:37	_anomaly_	drive declared itself as ok so the layers further up never ejected it from the array
2015-07-07 20:57:40	+bonsaikitten	_anomaly_: ah yes. very samsung
2015-07-07 20:57:52	+bonsaikitten	_anomaly_: had similar issues with the ~250G harddisks
2015-07-07 20:58:52	ephemer0l	is it possible to RAID0 platters in a drive? I've never tried but have always been curious...
2015-07-07 20:59:17	_anomaly_	also iirc these '3d v-nand' based ones have a terrible problem with current leakage causing the cells to need to be refreshed near constantly
2015-07-07 20:59:28	_anomaly_	which means their mtbf is SEVERELY reduced

2015-07-07 21:00:01	_anomaly_	samsung's trying to offload them before class action lawsuits i think
2015-07-07 21:00:55	ephemer0l	_anomaly_: wouldn't that make the possibility for the class to be bigger keeping them on the market making a biger payout to the lawyers?
2015-07-07 21:02:36	_anomaly_	you're far more likely to sue if you pay several hundred for something that is falsely advertising after the firmware fixes are applied than if you pay peanuts in a stock dump
2015-07-07 21:03:01	_anomaly_	plus the retailers are more likely to just swap out and bin the bad units that come back
2015-07-07 21:03:44	_anomaly_	i wouldn't take those for even $50 though
2015-07-07 21:03:49	_anomaly_	not after my experiences with them
2015-07-07 21:04:53	ephemer0l	thats how I feel about segates...
2015-07-07 21:10:39	_anomaly_	at least when seagates die they let you know, though
2015-07-07 21:11:06	_anomaly_	i'd use seagates expecting them to die within a year before I'd use samsungs which could die at any second, not tell you this, and silently trash your data

2015-07-07 21:14:12	_anomaly_	ended up writing random data to one, dd'ing it to the other, then checksumming both reading back

2015-07-21 20:15:05	catpig	and SCADA software publishers take the same approach to security as car makers
2015-07-21 20:15:20	inode33	There are poorly secured SCADA systems in control of power plants connected to the internet.
2015-07-21 20:15:34	catpig	Ionic_, thats my point - this isnt stupid, this is grossly negligent
2015-07-21 20:16:06	Ionic_	catpig: how can you prove they did know better?
2015-07-21 20:16:10	catpig	giving them the benefit of the doubt. ofc it has to be investigated if they were aware of the risk, in that case its malicious intent
2015-07-21 20:17:07	catpig	Ionic_, i really dont think you have to. legally speaking
2015-07-21 20:17:20	Ionic_	inode33: once you see "java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" printed on your HUD, you're likely screwed
2015-07-21 20:17:22	catpig	practically speaking ofc we're talking about a major US carmaker so it really doesnt matter ;)

2015-07-21 20:18:21	catpig	Ionic_, miller and valasek have proven it

2015-07-21 20:19:43	catpig	Ionic_, yeah in 1980 maybe, but not many years after the first time a security bug made the main TV news ;)
2015-07-21 20:19:52	catpig	like inode33 said
2015-07-21 20:20:10	catpig	but yeah, thats what they'd say, and the judge would go "oh, ok then, never mind"

2015-07-21 20:26:36	pepperoni	when i do an strace -p <pid> to connect to a process to see what its doing, and it shows 'wait4<-1 ...', any idea what that -1 means?
2015-07-21 20:26:57	pepperoni	that should be ... wait4(-1 ...)
2015-07-21 20:27:40	pepperoni	i'm not understanding the man page for that
2015-07-21 20:28:28	Ionic_	pepperoni: it's waiting for a child process to return or to get the signal SIGCHLD
2015-07-21 20:29:24	Ionic_	IOW, that process is just doing nothing currently, you probably want to look at (one of?) its child(ren) process(es)
2015-07-21 20:30:01	pepperoni	Ionic_: i'm trying to figure out why a dev just stops sending data across a serial connection
2015-07-21 20:30:26	pepperoni	so i used strace after the program stopped and thats all i saw
2015-07-21 20:30:44	Ionic_	well, find out what it spawned
2015-07-21 20:30:54	Ionic_	pstree -lp is your friend
2015-07-21 20:32:38	pepperoni	ok, thnx, thats one thing to look at
2015-07-21 20:33:20	pepperoni	although from what I can tell, the process is running fine, it's just not receivnig data from the device and i'm having a hard time figuring why data would just stop
2015-07-21 20:33:35	pepperoni	trying to find better ways to interogate the serial connection
2015-07-21 20:35:13	Ionic_	again, the process you're debugging has spawned a child process and waits for it to finish or do something else
2015-07-21 20:35:44	pepperoni	it should never finish, it's just listening for data
2015-07-21 20:36:03	Ionic_	are you talking about the child process or the parent that did call wait4()?
2015-07-21 20:36:41	pepperoni	the program i have uses an api that calls pthreads for callbacks to receive data
2015-07-21 20:37:09	pepperoni	so i'm assuming the reads within the api are whats doing the wait4
2015-07-21 20:37:18	Ionic_	uhm, okay, I haven't this yet

2015-07-22 18:52:09	inode33	looks like dd-wrt is packing brctl
2015-07-22 18:52:14	inode33	it at least has help information
2015-07-22 18:52:23	Ionic	busybox most likely
2015-07-22 18:52:28	kerframil	Ionic: indeed. it's farcical to claim that removing error messages is key to cutting down the footprint.
2015-07-22 18:52:43	kerframil	inode33: and, why not use the busybox implementation to begin with?

2015-07-22 18:53:12	kerframil	presumably, iproute2 has a bigger footprint than the busybox code
2015-07-22 18:53:12	Ionic	not even showing address or link states
2015-07-22 18:53:18	inode33	ip doesn't appear to do anything

2015-07-22 18:53:42	kerframil	http://svn.dd-wrt.com/changeset/18776 <-- looks like tunnel and set should work, at least
2015-07-22 18:53:59	Ionic	(but even that won't help because you cannot see added addresses without show)

2015-07-22 18:56:08	Ionic	inode33: adding a wifi device to the bridge will most likely go fatal
2015-07-22 18:56:11	inode33	Maybe I'm just crazy and missing the simple solution
2015-07-22 18:56:17	inode33	Why?
2015-07-22 18:56:26	Ionic	inode33: normally, you should trim the hostapd.conf to use the bridge= parameter
2015-07-22 18:56:31	Ionic	not add the bridge manually
2015-07-22 18:56:45	_anomaly_	your being crazy is besides the point

2015-07-22 18:57:40	inode33	Wifi bridges to the 4-port switch just fine.

2015-07-22 18:58:24	Ionic	the other ethernet device is separate and only used for PPPoE
2015-07-22 18:58:34	Ionic	yes
2015-07-22 18:58:47	inode33	I'd rather use a $40 router for that.
2015-07-22 18:58:53	inode33	different strokes though
2015-07-22 18:59:02	Ionic	but, again, mostly you're having to tell hostapd to add the device to a bridge for you
2015-07-22 18:59:08	Ionic	because otherwise it won't come up
2015-07-22 18:59:46	Ionic	the other problem is that AFAIK only adding to one bridge is supported
2015-07-22 19:00:01	Ionic	but maybe this whole embedded stuff is different anyway and not even using hostapd

2015-07-22 20:27:25	Ionic	so why is there neutral and ground to begin with? why not just ground?
2015-07-22 20:27:39	dugz	neutral should only tie in to the ground bus at the service panel
2015-07-22 20:28:05	+xiaomiao	iirc that's a 'floating ground' ? or is that something different again?
2015-07-22 20:29:02	dugz	neutral is a return path to ground (as i understand) and can have a substantial current, ground is a supposedly unloaded direct path to the same end point at the breaker box
2015-07-22 20:29:38	Ionic	xiaomiao: how *do* we connect stuff? I always assumed one conductor went to where the current comes from and the other one goes to neutral?
2015-07-22 20:30:05	Ionic	but that wouldn't work, I guess?
2015-07-22 20:30:19	+xiaomiao	Ionic: "it's complex" ;)
2015-07-22 20:30:50	Ionic	xiaomiao: now that sounds like what a woman would say
2015-07-22 20:31:13	dugz	i think neutral must be for US systems, since we have +120 and -120, they share the neutral but the earth ground is provided for safety
2015-07-22 20:31:42	+xiaomiao	Ionic: the joke there is that current is often best math'ed with complex numbers
2015-07-22 20:32:24	Ionic	dugz: huh? there's no +120 and -120 (as is... there is "something like that", but it's changing about 50 or 60 times per second...)
2015-07-22 20:33:01	+xiaomiao	there is 120V amplitude, at 0 degrees and 120 degrees and 240 degrees offset
2015-07-22 20:33:05	+xiaomiao	three phases
2015-07-22 20:33:55	dugz	Ionic: service boxes in the US are 220V 2-phase, so the phases are split into 120V circuits which are 180° out of phase with each other
2015-07-22 20:34:31	Ionic	but for 220V mean voltage, we need 320V amplitudes
2015-07-22 20:34:39	dugz	so +120VAC and -120VAC respectively
2015-07-22 20:34:42	+xiaomiao	dugz: I doubt that
2015-07-22 20:34:58	+xiaomiao	dugz: the generators in the power plants produce three phases, so you have 120 degree offset
2015-07-22 20:35:36	dugz	xiaomiao: there's no 3-phase here where i live
2015-07-22 20:35:51	+xiaomiao	dugz: yes there is
2015-07-22 20:35:58	dugz	thats usually only found in cities near railroad tracks
2015-07-22 20:36:18	+xiaomiao	dugz: the power plants don't produce 'only' two phases, that's not how the nationwide grid works

2015-07-22 20:36:57	dugz	xiaomiao: well i would sure like a 3-phase service entry
2015-07-22 20:37:03	inode33	hrm
2015-07-22 20:37:53	Ionic	xiaomiao: but you can always split up a phase, right?
2015-07-22 20:37:59	Ionic	and if that's at the house entry
2015-07-22 20:38:05	+xiaomiao	dugz: y'all still have aboveground powerlines?
2015-07-22 20:38:19	+xiaomiao	Ionic: yes, and I guess most houses only get two phases
2015-07-22 20:38:34	+xiaomiao	and then that gets split into two 'house circuits' to save money
2015-07-22 20:38:40	Ionic	xiaomiao: get two phases? by local transformators?
2015-07-22 20:38:41	dugz	xiaomiao: actually, i have been planning out a lawnmower to 3-phase generator for a good hobby project
2015-07-22 20:38:45	+xiaomiao	good way to make german electricians twitch and yell
2015-07-22 20:38:58	+xiaomiao	Ionic: yeah, you only run two wires into the house
2015-07-22 20:39:13	+xiaomiao	which would not be ok in everywhere-else :)
2015-07-22 20:39:32	dugz	xiaomiao: i live in a semi-rural area, big ugly powerline towers
2015-07-22 20:39:56	+xiaomiao	dugz: that's not how the rest of the world does it ;)
2015-07-22 20:40:17	dugz	look, if you elect me king, I'll fix this mess
2015-07-22 20:41:02	+xiaomiao	heh
2015-07-22 20:41:11	+xiaomiao	I can imagine how that'll go down
2015-07-22 20:41:26	+xiaomiao	"what, flushing toilets, in my city? NO WAY!"
2015-07-22 20:41:59	inode33	Right
2015-07-22 20:42:18	Ionic	xiaomiao: the rest of the world also uses above-ground power lines (for long distance transport)
2015-07-22 20:42:22	dugz	change the US to metric time .... profit!
2015-07-22 20:42:30	inode33	As I thought, UPnP isn't going to work on a subnet, heh
2015-07-22 20:42:35	+xiaomiao	dugz: if I were involved - do like china, *only* allow fiber to be used for any new internet deployments
2015-07-22 20:42:42	inode33	dugz: We're already using seconds :)
2015-07-22 20:42:53	Ionic	xiaomiao: smart idea...
2015-07-22 20:42:58	+xiaomiao	and then split it in a strongly regulated infrastructure company that has to sell to everyone
2015-07-22 20:43:03	dugz	xiaomiao: are fiber cards expensive at the endpoinds?
2015-07-22 20:43:14	Ionic	not anymore, really
2015-07-22 20:43:17	+xiaomiao	and the service providers/ISPs that have to rent from the local infra monopolist
2015-07-22 20:43:21	+xiaomiao	dugz: not at all
2015-07-22 20:43:26	+xiaomiao	dugz: and the fiber is cheap too
2015-07-22 20:43:35	Ionic	I mean, it depends on what you want
2015-07-22 20:43:40	Ionic	10G is still expensive
2015-07-22 20:43:44	+xiaomiao	Shanghai is wiring up the whole city, the cost is pretty boring
2015-07-22 20:43:58	+xiaomiao	Ionic: only because it's not that common, and needs lots of power, etc.
2015-07-22 20:44:07	+xiaomiao	Ionic: 'only' gbit would be quite reasonable cheap
2015-07-22 20:44:10	Ionic	xiaomiao: right, but it's also fiber
2015-07-22 20:44:12	Ionic	yeah
2015-07-22 20:44:27	Ionic	100 MBit is like "lol take my dollar"
2015-07-22 20:44:30	+xiaomiao	Ionic: indeed, later upgrading is easy
2015-07-22 20:45:02	+xiaomiao	also, provide 1Mbit or equivalent 'for free' for low-income families
2015-07-22 20:45:04	+xiaomiao	:D
2015-07-22 20:45:11	+xiaomiao	yes, I'm that kind of donkey
2015-07-22 20:45:50	Ionic	no need to, really...
2015-07-22 20:46:08	+xiaomiao	Ionic: oh yes, lots of need
2015-07-22 20:46:15	+xiaomiao	suddenly these people have access to information
2015-07-22 20:46:18	Ionic	$30/month isn't a big amount for 100 mbit/s and a telephone flatrate
2015-07-22 20:46:29	+xiaomiao	that's 10% of their disposable income, you crazy
2015-07-22 20:46:34	Ionic	hmmm
2015-07-22 20:46:36	+xiaomiao	they need food etc.
2015-07-22 20:46:56	Ionic	$300 a month? where is that a thing?
2015-07-22 20:46:58	+xiaomiao	so having internet 'for free' is a nice way to allow them to communicate
2015-07-22 20:47:14	Ionic	yeah
2015-07-22 20:47:15	+xiaomiao	Ionic: in germany it's around that amount, Hartz IV max is about 400Eur
2015-07-22 20:47:19	inode33	100mbit for $30 a month?
2015-07-22 20:47:28	dugz	china should provide free internet
2015-07-22 20:47:30	Ionic	xiaomiao: yeah but that's like $500
2015-07-22 20:47:32	+xiaomiao	inode33: I have 50Mbit for about $25 and could upgrade
2015-07-22 20:47:38	+xiaomiao	Ionic: normalize for buying power
2015-07-22 20:47:39	inode33	Where do you live?
2015-07-22 20:47:43	Ionic	inode33: yep, in sweden
2015-07-22 20:47:48	+xiaomiao	Ionic: $300 in china is not the same as $300 in norway
2015-07-22 20:48:14	Ionic	xiaomiao: true, but the service prices will also be normalized, I hope
2015-07-22 20:48:26	Ionic	xiaomiao: just don't make it asymmetrically and I'm in
2015-07-22 20:48:39	+xiaomiao	Ionic: mostly yes - I have unlimited 50/10Mbit internet for about $25 equivalent
2015-07-22 20:48:52	+xiaomiao	next step in fixing the US: healthcare
2015-07-22 20:48:54	+xiaomiao	swiss model
2015-07-22 20:49:05	Ionic	I pay 60 EUR, so $80? for 50/10
2015-07-22 20:49:11	dugz	our healthcare is modeled after the swiss model now
2015-07-22 20:49:14	+xiaomiao	regulation mandates (1) 85%+ of income have to be used on patient care
2015-07-22 20:49:35	+xiaomiao	and (2) profit is limited to 6%, anything above that is carried over as reductions for next year
2015-07-22 20:49:39	+xiaomiao	dugz: not at all
2015-07-22 20:49:42	Ionic	dugz: you don't have a healthcare system
2015-07-22 20:49:52	+xiaomiao	(3) unemployed are covered by the state
2015-07-22 20:50:05	+xiaomiao	so you can't lose insurance when you lose your job
2015-07-22 20:50:19	+xiaomiao	now, the swiss trick - everyone has to be insured
2015-07-22 20:51:45	+xiaomiao	and now, the finishing touch - the government can negotiate prices, and they are valid country- (or at least state-)wide
2015-07-22 20:51:58	+xiaomiao	so an aspirin ... costs 45 cents
2015-07-22 20:52:13	Ionic	a pill or a package?
2015-07-22 20:52:15	+xiaomiao	no more, no less. If you don't want to sell at that price another seller will be found
2015-07-22 20:52:25	+xiaomiao	Ionic: let's say per pill, for hospital use
2015-07-22 20:52:32	+xiaomiao	Ionic: still a lot, but you nail down prices
2015-07-22 20:52:43	Ionic	45c for a pill sounds high, but okay
2015-07-22 20:52:56	+xiaomiao	and since the government buys 2M pills for the hospitals they have leverage
2015-07-22 20:53:19	Ionic	xiaomiao: what about hospitals in general? state-owned or private?
2015-07-22 20:53:22	+xiaomiao	Ionic: US hospitals often bill $50 for the aspirin, $20 for the cup, and $25 for the water
2015-07-22 20:53:33	+xiaomiao	Ionic: doesn't matter, they all take patients with any insurance card
2015-07-22 20:53:55	Ionic	xiaomiao: oh yes it does matter whether they are profit-oriented or not
2015-07-22 20:54:02	+xiaomiao	private hospitals can offer extra service optionally, but if they want to be hospitals they have to provide the basic package to anyone
2015-07-22 20:54:07	+xiaomiao	Ionic: no, doesn't
2015-07-22 20:54:12	+xiaomiao	proper regulation
2015-07-22 20:54:48	Ionic	xiaomiao: but why would I run a hospital if I can't make good money off it?
2015-07-22 20:54:58	+xiaomiao	Ionic: then you don't ...
2015-07-22 20:55:06	+xiaomiao	but if you work well you can still make a reasonable profit
2015-07-22 20:55:14	+xiaomiao	not 175% as before, maybe only 10%
2015-07-22 20:55:28	+xiaomiao	is that something to worry about?
2015-07-22 20:55:45	Ionic	so, in the end, no sane investor would be bothering to invest because there are better options
2015-07-22 20:56:00	+xiaomiao	thus the government takes over everything
2015-07-22 20:56:04	+xiaomiao	...acceptable conditions
2015-07-22 20:56:08	 *	dugz sets up a 3-card monte stand
2015-07-22 20:56:48	Ionic	xiaomiao: I'd prefer state-owned hospitals and the like, but it sounds like impossible to finance
2015-07-22 20:57:02	+xiaomiao	Ionic: nationalise existing hospitals if they refuse
2015-07-22 20:57:10	+xiaomiao	offer them a buyout at 30% market value
2015-07-22 20:57:18	+xiaomiao	incentives :D
2015-07-22 20:57:57	+xiaomiao	I think I would not be a 'good' President
2015-07-22 20:58:01	+xiaomiao	but an effective one
2015-07-22 20:58:04	dugz	i am lucky to be a patron of the VA health care system, and I feel that they do a great job
2015-07-22 20:58:11	Ionic	dunno
2015-07-22 20:58:18	dugz	so the feds can run a tight hospital
2015-07-22 20:58:22	Ionic	sounds too good to work out
2015-07-22 20:58:32	+xiaomiao	Ionic: yes, switzerland is a fiction
2015-07-22 20:58:36	+xiaomiao	it doesn't exist!
2015-07-22 20:58:48	+xiaomiao	they can't provide better service at half the cost of the US!
2015-07-22 20:58:50	Ionic	xiaomiao: I've never been there, especially not a month ago
2015-07-22 20:59:02	+xiaomiao	Ionic: I haven't been there in ~3 years now
2015-07-22 20:59:21	Ionic	but I was there only very briefly, for about 12 hours
2015-07-22 21:00:00	dugz	the chances of my getting to switzerland in this life are dwindling rapidly
2015-07-22 21:00:35	+xiaomiao	dugz: so you're saying there is a chance?
2015-07-22 21:00:38	dugz	i want to yodel from the alps in my lederhosen
2015-07-22 21:00:44	Ionic	dugz: I only have to drive a 100 miles to get there

2015-07-22 21:02:48	+xiaomiao	that's a game I don't understand
2015-07-22 21:02:55	+xiaomiao	it emulates the boring monotony of reality
2015-07-22 21:02:57	+xiaomiao	... why?
2015-07-22 21:03:01	Ionic	because it's fun
2015-07-22 21:03:08	Ionic	there's also a garbage truck simulator
2015-07-22 21:03:17	dugz	not really, its kind of challenging to drive those big bohemoths
2015-07-22 21:03:34	+xiaomiao	I could solve a problem that gets me money instead
2015-07-22 21:03:37	+xiaomiao	I like money
2015-07-22 21:03:52	dugz	me too!
2015-07-22 21:03:53	Ionic	dugz: I had to spend $60 to drive there, for 12 hours
2015-07-22 21:03:57	Ionic	FML
2015-07-22 21:04:23	Ionic	my toll thingy is still valid until february, though, but I don't have anything planned there
2015-07-22 21:04:30	dugz	italy has zillions of toll booths in my game, its scary
2015-07-22 21:04:48	Ionic	yeah
2015-07-22 21:05:16	Ionic	italy is even worse, because you have to pay constantly and every single time you pass a booth
2015-07-22 21:05:19	+xiaomiao	Ionic: go to Interlaken, enjoy nature
2015-07-22 21:05:57	Ionic	but, would still have been cheaper than the 100 miles within switzerland, I guess
2015-07-22 21:06:07	Ionic	probably more like 70, dunno

2015-07-22 21:08:05	Ionic	xiaomiao: or maybe I just don't like it when I'm alone, what do I know

2015-07-22 21:08:35	dugz	i did the best i could, i think i cut it close enough to the joint that it can form woundwood, time will tell

2015-07-22 21:09:15	dugz	i have pills for that
2015-07-22 21:09:18	+xiaomiao	Ionic: happens when you're alone
2015-07-22 21:09:34	Ionic	ah, no, I'm often talking to "myself"
2015-07-22 21:09:54	Ionic	which is the worst description ever, probably
2015-07-22 21:10:19	Ionic	I don't talk to "myself", I talk to better organize and express thoughts
2015-07-22 21:10:33	Ionic	and I certainly don't talk to anyone in particular
2015-07-22 21:10:34	dugz	i have some chatter in my mind

2015-07-22 21:11:52	Ionic	that's another weird thing
2015-07-22 21:12:06	Ionic	when people are hearing voices, these voices always seem to tell them to do something bad
2015-07-22 21:12:13	Ionic	but never to, dunno, hug a tree
2015-07-22 21:12:16	Ionic	why is that?
2015-07-22 21:13:03	dugz	no it does, my wife's ex was out putting incomprehensible flyers on cars
2015-07-22 21:13:42	Ionic	dugz: bad example, I guess... how about "marvel at that stone"?
2015-07-22 21:15:47	dugz	i don't get voices, but i can suffer from auditory hallucinations; e.g. weird musical sound. sleep generally helps. afaik its a dopamine imbalance thing

2015-07-22 22:47:45	dugz	he just needs a basic general purpose system, good but cheap
2015-07-22 22:47:57	+xiaomiao	dugz: sounds good
2015-07-22 22:48:07	+xiaomiao	dugz: add as much RAM as you can, get an SSD if it's in the budget
2015-07-22 22:49:18	dugz	i guess these APU things really like the faster RAM
2015-07-22 22:49:54	+xiaomiao	hrm, the A10 I have is quite reasonable
2015-07-22 22:50:03	+xiaomiao	would be perfectly adequate as workstation
2015-07-22 22:50:24	+xiaomiao	it's my testing / sacrificial box, currently decommisioned due to lack of storage
2015-07-22 22:50:41	dugz	I have a Phenom-II plus a hd7850, the A10 should be at least as good as what I have
2015-07-22 22:51:18	+xiaomiao	I'd expect slightly lower graphics performance, but noticeably higher CPU throughput
2015-07-22 22:51:28	+xiaomiao	~30% at least for same clock
2015-07-22 22:51:37	dugz	that sounds like a good assesment

2015-07-22 22:53:29	dugz	i need to make this thing small,like htpc size
2015-07-22 22:53:38	+xiaomiao	I think for some microbenchmarks it's closer to 50%, afair the Phenom2 -> FX was ~25% already, and FX -> APU was another ~20%
2015-07-22 22:53:52	+xiaomiao	luckily I have all those available for testing :D
2015-07-22 22:54:14	dugz	i'm still pretty happy with my system. no urgent need to upgrade
2015-07-22 22:54:33	dugz	its old too
2015-07-22 22:55:46	+xiaomiao	I just need storage
2015-07-22 22:55:56	+xiaomiao	down to two sata disks and a crummy stupid SSD
2015-07-22 22:56:05	+xiaomiao	SSD is slower than single SATA disk ...
2015-07-22 22:56:11	dugz	I would like to have more RAM, and IOMMU units though to play with VMs, so I am thinking about making a new workstation somewhere on the horizon
2015-07-22 22:56:41	+xiaomiao	the APUs are imo a good starting point, get the 'smallest' one and upgrade when your budget allows
2015-07-22 22:57:10	dugz	i added a 256G ssd about a year ago, crucial mx100, its nice, seems snappy
2015-07-22 22:58:15	+xiaomiao	they appear to be the cheapest that are not horribad
2015-07-22 22:59:10	dugz	yeah its cheap and has good performance too
2015-07-22 23:00:14	dugz	i guess the controllers on those things makes a big difference
2015-07-22 23:00:43	inode33	Why does anyone manufacture crappy SSDs?
2015-07-22 23:00:54	inode33	Wouldn't your reputation get trashed for it?
2015-07-22 23:01:16	+xiaomiao	inode33: cheap
2015-07-22 23:01:27	+xiaomiao	got a 64G one for about $7 or so
2015-07-22 23:01:45	+xiaomiao	it'd be perfect for a supercheap desktop / kiosk machine
2015-07-22 23:03:13	inode33	Don't those knockoffs fail after a year?

2015-07-28 16:09:15	+UberPinguin	so it turns out that having STONITH configured can bite you in the rectum if the nodes are unable to join the cluster after restarting. Because each assumes the other is down, so they take turns rebooting each other. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2015-07-28 16:52:46	+Chainsaw	We have the enterprise version at work, but the free one will do just fine for a little private cloud deployment like that.

2015-07-28 16:54:17	linux_dream	so my only back up will be my external hard disk, in october

2015-07-28 16:54:45	mvaenskae	but that is erm... it requires a reliable and low-powered machine
2015-07-28 16:54:52	+Chainsaw	mvaenskae: I have that.
2015-07-28 16:54:55	mvaenskae	so the rpi falls out the equation
2015-07-28 16:55:18	+Chainsaw	mvaenskae: Well, not supremely low-powered. I've just made sure it falls within the base load of the solar PV system on the roof.
2015-07-28 16:55:33	mvaenskae	oh, i don't have solar so yeah :)

2015-07-28 16:55:47	+Chainsaw	mvaenskae: When you want tens of TBs, not many of the raspberry pi solutions hold up.
2015-07-28 16:56:01	mvaenskae	i just want 8TB in raid6
2015-07-28 16:56:17	mvaenskae	that will suffice for all my computing needs i think
2015-07-28 16:56:27	+Chainsaw	mvaenskae: RAID6 is good. I long back to the days where 8TB was enough. I think it was 2008.

2015-07-28 16:58:51	specing	don't. Android is insecure
2015-07-28 16:59:44	linux_dream	yeah apparently it needs to be synced through dropbox or so
2015-07-28 16:59:53	linux_dream	I mean the password database
2015-07-28 17:00:07	mvaenskae	linux_dream: the password-file offline via usb if there is a need; better to have only the needed passwords in an extra db that you put then there
2015-07-28 17:00:37	mvaenskae	that extra db you can then share
2015-07-28 17:01:18	linux_dream	usb into android? not possible in my case
2015-07-28 17:01:43	mvaenskae	may i ask what android you use?
2015-07-28 17:01:53	linux_dream	4.3 or something like that
2015-07-28 17:02:02	mvaenskae	the device...

2015-07-28 17:02:08	linux_dream	moto g 1st ed
2015-07-28 17:02:24	mvaenskae	how do you charge it?
2015-07-28 17:02:37	linux_dream	through a non usb plug
2015-07-28 17:02:38	+UberPinguin	force of will
2015-07-28 17:03:27	mvaenskae	moto g has a microusb
2015-07-28 17:03:34	mvaenskae	it says so on the manufacturer website
2015-07-28 17:04:02	linux_dream	well  I don't want to pay for an extra cable, where I live it's going to be more than twice as expensive than in the us
2015-07-28 17:04:05	mvaenskae	micro-usb to usb convertor and you can just plug in usbs given it has otg support (which it should have)
2015-07-28 17:04:27	linux_dream	probably around 50 bucks for that
2015-07-28 17:04:28	mvaenskae	the last part i am guesstimating
2015-07-28 17:04:39	mvaenskae	those are like 20 cents in china
2015-07-28 17:04:40	linux_dream	no way I will pay this to sync some files on my phone
2015-07-28 17:04:48	linux_dream	yeah but I'm not in china
2015-07-28 17:05:01	mvaenskae	even then they shouldn't be expensive
2015-07-28 17:05:35	linux_dream	I took a year to pay the phone here,  it's nowadays over 450 dollars and in the us it's considered as a cheap phone
2015-07-28 17:05:41	mvaenskae	but your call, not gonna force you to buy one; i just know they are extremely helpful
2015-07-28 17:05:48	linux_dream	in the us of course the phone is under 200 bucks
2015-07-28 17:06:14	mvaenskae	may i ask where you are?
2015-07-28 17:06:19	linux_dream	argentina
2015-07-28 17:06:36	linux_dream	think of it as "venezuela-like" or "cuba-like"  somehow
2015-07-28 17:06:46	mvaenskae	hm, i truly don't know how the market is over there :)
2015-07-28 17:06:54	linux_dream	impossble to import technology with a normal price

2015-07-28 17:08:12	linux_dream	but I'm not sure I'll do it
2015-07-28 17:08:42	linux_dream	coz so far I only have dropbox and gmail accounts to deal with
2015-07-28 17:09:43	mvaenskae	depending on how often you need the passwords maybe type them out?
2015-07-28 17:10:06	Tatsh	bash can do anything
2015-07-28 17:10:24	mvaenskae	it is annoying for long passwords but once done it is done :)

2015-07-31 12:29:38	AsumFace	huh, lol
2015-07-31 12:29:39	+iamben	it's not resizable, as far as the WM sees
2015-07-31 12:30:09	+iamben	anyway i dont want to USE fullscreen mode, i just want to see why it segfaults when i accidentally switch to fullscreen mode
2015-07-31 12:31:03	AsumFace	hmm, the non-matching sizes could cause the segfault then. my vm's size matches my scree
2015-07-31 12:32:08	+iamben	well im sure it's involved, it switches my xorg resolution then explodes =) but i think im reading that spicec is officiall deprecated/unmaintained in favor of spice-gtk and others, so i should just switch over

2015-08-01 07:39:51	giuseppe_	iamben why ?
2015-08-01 07:40:07	giuseppe_	do you still install x86 on your 64 bit machine ? why ?
2015-08-01 07:40:07	+iamben	it's not a maintainable system

2015-08-01 07:41:44	+iamben	giuseppe_: because there is no package manager or other tools to maintain sanity of your installed applications, or upgrade them, or anything
2015-08-01 07:41:51	hosler	iamben: so i could put it in CFLAGS in make.conf and that would work?

2015-08-01 07:42:09	hosler	ok

2015-08-01 07:52:41	+iamben	that is probably a more proper fix, the command line thing is just a hack to confirm "yep it was missing -lX11"

2015-08-01 07:58:19	hosler	haha
2015-08-01 07:59:22	giuseppe_	iamben.. so are you saying that from LFS one can't have a package manager ?
2015-08-01 07:59:31	+iamben	giuseppe_: not a properly integrated one
2015-08-01 07:59:44	giuseppe_	so how people create distros ?
2015-08-01 08:00:32	+iamben	if you are going to create your own distro from the ground up, that is "maintainable" in some way
2015-08-01 08:01:02	+iamben	in that you do the work of an entire distro team, working 300 hours a week to keep up, and you mostly have a working system with all the packages you want
2015-08-01 08:02:15	giuseppe_	iamben... so it is not a good idea using LFS as laptop distro ?
2015-08-01 08:02:35	+iamben	giuseppe_: it's a pretty bad idea
2015-08-01 08:03:05	+iamben	it's useful as a learning exercise i suppose, but it will not be a maintainable system
2015-08-01 08:03:14	giuseppe_	ok... why package managers can't handle source as you said ?
2015-08-01 08:03:30	+iamben	some package managers can, like portage
2015-08-01 08:05:14	giuseppe_	ok... so what if after installing LFS i install emerge ?
2015-08-01 08:07:03	+iamben	you will need a whole lot more tools to make a maintainable system, you'll end up building gentoo basically
2015-08-01 08:08:09	giuseppe_	iamben... which tools ?
2015-08-01 08:08:40	+iamben	like python-exec, for example
2015-08-01 08:08:45	giuseppe_	i would like to do it only as an exercise...
2015-08-01 08:08:50	+iamben	several other *-wrapper tools, *-config tools
2015-08-01 08:08:54	giuseppe_	isn't it installed while installing python
2015-08-01 08:09:26	giuseppe_	??
2015-08-01 08:09:28	+iamben	it's only installed w/ python if you adhere to deps
2015-08-01 08:09:42	+iamben	if you adhere to all deps, you WILL build gentoo, a full one
2015-08-01 08:10:02	giuseppe_	iamben... did you already try ?
2015-08-01 08:10:03	+iamben	i would not waste your time, you won't learn much useful stuff that you wouldn't already get from gentoo
2015-08-01 08:10:05	giuseppe_	:D

2015-08-01 18:33:39	kerframil	linux_dream: 1) one should not slurp indiscriminately from either random or urandom 2) single read will be allowed, at most, 512 bytes from random 3) use urandom 4) use urandom

2015-08-01 18:35:55	linux_dream	using od , I can get random chars from random
2015-08-01 18:36:04	linux_dream	using tr  I'm unable

2015-08-01 19:02:59	kerframil	linux_dream: that's a good reason. don't think that urandom is a low quality source. it's the appropriate source for the majority of use cases. the Usage section in the random(4) manpage explains somewhat.

2015-08-01 19:08:02	linux_dream	the idea was just to have fun though

2015-08-01 19:08:16	linux_dream	and i don't think my computer needs /dev/random data
2015-08-01 19:08:18	kerframil	the point stands though. it's not designed for large, protracted reads
2015-08-01 19:08:26	linux_dream	yeah
2015-08-01 19:08:40	kerframil	it's supposed to be limited to 512 bytes for a single read and even that is quite a lot by its standards
2015-08-01 19:08:48	kerframil	you could deplete your entropy pretty quickly
2015-08-01 19:08:59	linux_dream	that's what I do with this command: strings -1 < /dev/random
2015-08-01 19:09:05	linux_dream	it eats the entropy in less than 1 second
2015-08-01 19:09:12	kerframil	yup
2015-08-01 19:09:13	linux_dream	and then produces  a slow output of random chars

2015-08-01 19:33:28	kerframil	if you're going to read from /dev/random, I would suggest dd with a minimal bs. no more than bs=512 count=1, at most.
2015-08-01 19:35:05	linux_dream	for now I just want to print the first char of a command.  I followed the suggestions there: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/3454/grabbing-the-first-x-characters-for-a-string-from-a-pipe   but that doesn't work for me
2015-08-01 19:35:54	kerframil	what about the read suggestion above?
2015-08-01 19:36:00	linux_dream	strings -1 < /dev/random | head -c-1   returns nothing but strings -1 < /dev/random    returns a constant flow
2015-08-01 19:36:15	linux_dream	I tried to adjust the read  command to my command but I got errors
2015-08-01 19:39:15	kerframil	ok, so you're just trying to read one byte from random there?
2015-08-01 19:41:08	linux_dream	no, one char
2015-08-01 19:41:59	linux_dream	cut -c-1  should return the 1st byte I think.  but head was supposed to return the 1st char I think
2015-08-01 19:43:06	kerframil	I would go with: char="$(dd if=/dev/random iflag=fullblock bs=1 count=1)"
2015-08-01 19:43:07	linux_dream	hmm I think I know why
2015-08-01 19:43:20	linux_dream	the problem is that my command strings -1 < /dev/random     never finishes to be executed
2015-08-01 19:43:24	kerframil	or, better: char="$(dd if=/dev/random iflag=fullblock bs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null)"
2015-08-01 19:43:59	linux_dream	char="$(dd if=/dev/random iflag=fullblock bs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null)"   does not output anything for me
2015-08-01 19:44:13	kerframil	the output is in $char
2015-08-01 19:44:25	kerframil	if you wan to see it, just run the dd command itself
2015-08-01 19:44:47	kerframil	or: printf "%s" "$char"
2015-08-01 19:44:58	kerframil	it works fine
2015-08-01 19:45:24	kerframil	it also avoids the problem of consuming any more from (u)random than you tell it to
2015-08-01 19:45:47	linux_dream	the output is }%
2015-08-01 19:46:11	linux_dream	and now an unprintable char  followed by %
2015-08-01 19:46:46	kerframil	what are you running
2015-08-01 19:47:17	kerframil	it does exactly what it says. if you doubt it, pipe the output of the dd command through od.
2015-08-01 19:47:29	linux_dream	char="$(dd if=/dev/random iflag=fullblock bs=1 count=1 2>/dev/null)"        printf "%s" "$char"
2015-08-01 19:47:34	kerframil	ok
2015-08-01 19:47:40	kerframil	that % is probably your bash prompt
2015-08-01 19:47:55	kerframil	if you want a newline, printf "%s\n"
2015-08-01 19:48:35	linux_dream	oh

2015-08-01 19:49:07	linux_dream	now only need to filter out printable char
2015-08-01 19:49:13	linux_dream	ok
2015-08-01 19:49:28	kerframil	if you need more, bump up bs. of course, I still recommend using urandom in the end.

2015-08-01 20:26:33	linux_dream	yay that works
2015-08-01 20:28:24	linux_dream	where can I add the special chars ?
2015-08-01 20:29:42	kerframil	it's using a regex. I would suggest you do:
2015-08-01 20:30:11	linux_dream	btw I replaced urandom by random
2015-08-01 20:30:19	kerframil	local re='a-zA-Z0-9-!"@/#$%^&*()_+~'
2015-08-01 20:30:30	kerframil	[[ $char =~ $re ]] || continue
2015-08-01 20:30:55	kerframil	it's safer to put a non-trivial regex in a variable first in bash.
2015-08-01 20:31:08	kerframil	however, you can assign that regex just once, before you begin the loop.
2015-08-01 20:31:28	kerframil	meh, I'll paste again
2015-08-01 20:33:03	kerframil	actually, let me play around with this for a moment. maybe an extglob would be better for you.

2015-08-01 20:58:39	linux_dream	I've got a reply .  I see that tr  needed at least 4096 bytes or something like that to return an output
2015-08-01 20:58:48	linux_dream	and that takes around 5 hours according to the guy who replied
2015-08-01 20:59:05	kerframil	dd could have been useful in another situation, but in this case, it occurs to me that using the read built-in would be much faster. significantly so.
2015-08-01 20:59:16	kerframil	I just benchmarked it for generating 1000 passwords
2015-08-01 20:59:27	kerframil	you can use: read -N1 -d '' char < /dev/urandom
2015-08-01 20:59:42	kerframil	with that, I'd say it's reasonable for a pure bash solution
2015-08-01 21:00:27	kerframil	on my system, that cut down the time to generate 1000 passwords by 47 seconds

2015-08-01 21:09:26	jesuisb	that's because you used urandom instead of random eh?
2015-08-01 21:09:30	 *	jesuisb is canadian tonight
2015-08-01 21:10:08	kerframil	I've used urandom in all my examples, as is appropriate. no, the issue was that the call to dd actually adds a lot of overhead.
2015-08-01 21:10:31	kerframil	over a number of iterations, it adds-up as compared to using read
2015-08-01 21:11:14	kerframil	roughly 1 seconds vs 47 seconds with regard to my test
2015-08-01 21:11:15	jesuisb	i guess i'm confused then, the question much earlier was about /dev/random, and the response linux_dream refers to with "5 hours" to generate 4096 bytes is certainly talking about random not urandom
2015-08-01 21:11:29	kerframil	oh, you're commenting on the thread? sorry.
2015-08-01 21:11:33	kerframil	I haven't read it, actually
2015-08-01 21:11:35	linux_dream	does not matter, if I replace urandom by random it works
2015-08-01 21:11:47	jesuisb	nah i'm just stickin my nose in where it doesnt belong, i've missed important details
2015-08-01 21:11:51	jesuisb	do carry on and ignore me! :)
2015-08-01 21:11:53	linux_dream	what kerframil did works fine if I use random,  unlike all my other attempts
2015-08-01 21:12:14	kerframil	it works but it is an abuse of random. I hope that you don't keep it that way.
2015-08-01 21:12:29	linux_dream	hm why not
2015-08-01 21:12:41	kerframil	we went over this earlier
2015-08-01 21:12:46	linux_dream	let's say I want to generate a random password of 30 chars.  I can freely use urandom or random
2015-08-01 21:12:58	linux_dream	yeah but I mean there's nothing bad with having no entropy left
2015-08-01 21:13:07	linux_dream	no program depends on it, nor anybody
2015-08-01 21:13:34	kerframil	it can be bad. if this is purely academic and your box is doing no important work, sure.
2015-08-01 21:13:45	linux_dream	oh
2015-08-01 21:13:51	kerframil	that doesn't change the fact that random is not intended for this purpose. the reasons were given earlier.
2015-08-01 21:13:58	linux_dream	ok
2015-08-01 21:14:11	linux_dream	but yeah I won't use random to generate random passwords
2015-08-01 21:14:26	linux_dream	nor urandom for that matter
2015-08-01 21:14:31	kerframil	it's used to obtain very small amounts of very high quality random data that can be used to seed a CPRNG.
2015-08-01 21:14:34	linux_dream	(I'll use keepassx)
2015-08-01 21:14:50	linux_dream	ok I see
2015-08-01 21:14:51	kerframil	99% of userspace will be using urandom
2015-08-01 21:15:02	kerframil	even openssl rand does, for example
2015-08-01 21:15:09	linux_dream	yeah I guess keepassx uses urandom
2015-08-01 21:15:19	linux_dream	pwgen program uses urandom too
2015-08-01 21:15:28	kerframil	read Bernstein's post. it puts it into perspecitve.
2015-08-01 21:18:08	kerframil	in particular, check the final paragraph of of the Usage section of random(4), which I suggested reading earlier
2015-08-01 21:18:22	kerframil	if that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will ;)
2015-08-01 21:25:18	linux_dream	one question though kerframil
2015-08-01 21:25:48	linux_dream	if I use urandom, at first it will look in the entropy pool and therefore lower my entropy to 0 if I extract a large number of chars
2015-08-01 21:26:09	linux_dream	when there's no more entropy left it will start a random number generator to continue the job
2015-08-01 21:26:15	linux_dream	is this correct?
2015-08-01 21:26:40	linux_dream	so either way I'm left without entropy in the pool, whether I use urandom or random
2015-08-01 21:27:48	kerframil	I don't think so. 256 bits of entropy is enough for a CPRNG to give you high quality random data for quite some time.

2015-08-01 21:34:35	kerframil	the only time that reading from /dev/urandom could be dangerous is just after the linux kernel has initialized, before any entropy has been gathered. gentoo, like any decent distro, has a method for seeding the pool early during the boot process.
2015-08-01 21:37:19	kerframil	when you shutdown, some data is taken from urandom and dumped into /var/lib/misc/random-seed
2015-08-01 21:38:04	kerframil	that is used for seeding upon next booting
2015-08-01 21:38:48	kerframil	as I said, only a very small quantity is required. gentoo writes out 512 bytes, which is plenty.

2015-08-02 08:28:32	+iamben	bschnzl: that is incorrect.  you are probably getting unstable versions of random packages.

2015-08-02 11:02:29	Milo-	once apt-get upgrade is finished, you'll have to do a reboot and then your system is broken beyond repair and you'll have to reinstall Windows.

2015-08-02 12:26:55	redcheckers	wiktor_b: so if A: a thief walks off with my laptop, and B: they mistakenly think there's something worth breaking into it for, or C: they work at a shop like that and get free shop time to run hashing functions...
2015-08-02 12:27:11	redcheckers	wiktor_b: then i'd rather have the best 4 megabit password i can .

2015-08-02 12:29:47	redcheckers	NeddySeagoon: but generally speaking, having a power on password in the uefi/bios (and a bios password) , a bootloader password, and then a disk encryption layer, before getting to the tty prompt to log in, seems like a reasonable base layer of security.

2015-08-02 12:36:38	redcheckers	NeddySeagoon: well, i bought this one because it had a cyrillic keyboard
2015-08-02 12:36:56	redcheckers	well, and it wasn't an ipad.
2015-08-02 12:37:05	redcheckers	those were the 2 things i had in mind when i went to their computer shop
2015-08-02 12:37:15	redcheckers	1: it needs a keyboard. and 2: i don't want an ipad
2015-08-02 12:37:44	redcheckers	but for what i paid for it. i don't think there can be much resale value. and it's got the moldavian power plug prongs.
2015-08-02 12:38:33	+NeddySeagoon	redcheckers: I use dvorak-uk and I can't buy a keyboard like that and I've looked at everything under £500.   I got a normal keyboard and move the keytops around.  The confuses the BIOS though
2015-08-02 12:38:41	redcheckers	NeddySeagoon: i guess maybe there's like a bottom end price for a random drug user to swap any running tv or any running laptop for a dime bag of thc ?
2015-08-02 12:39:01	redcheckers	NeddySeagoon: i did that once with a 104e key that used a ps1 jack
2015-08-02 12:39:36	redcheckers	NeddySeagoon: but i found that i type fast enough on a qwerty or qwertz to beat the low latency kernels i've installed in the past ...
2015-08-02 12:39:54	redcheckers	so i decided the only fun reason to keep dvorak would be so nobody else could use my computer
2015-08-02 12:40:07	+NeddySeagoon	The power plugs can be changed.  Read the fine print on the PSU itself.  It will be universal
2015-08-02 12:40:31	redcheckers	it might be. but i dont have the thing to change it for... and i do have the outlet converter

2015-08-02 12:50:51	redcheckers	doc235: i can type 190 words per minute if i have to think about what to write... and above 212 if its familiar subject matter, or things like passwords that i know... or if someone else is speaking as i type i can type at the rate of speech
2015-08-02 12:51:00	redcheckers	sometimes faster if i know what they will say next
2015-08-02 12:51:45	redcheckers	doc235: my 76 character disk password i can type in under 22 seconds, and its not exactly 'sensible'
2015-08-02 12:52:56	redcheckers	it's actually part of a poem by grigori vieru... so its all dictionary stuff though, so maybe not a good example

2015-08-02 15:47:30	mvaenskae	Tatsh: why?
2015-08-02 15:47:31	Tatsh	laptop BIOS might have the CPU hard-coded
2015-08-02 15:47:43	Tatsh	laptop BIOSes have had hardware hard-coded quite often
2015-08-02 15:47:53	mvaenskae	Tatsh: what if the cpu is faulty?

2015-08-02 15:48:24	Tatsh	it means if the remainderi s 0
2015-08-02 15:48:26	Cheaterman	like 4 % 3 = 1
2015-08-02 15:48:29	+doc235	ahhh ok thanks

2015-08-02 15:49:23	Tatsh	4 % 3 = 1/3
2015-08-02 15:49:34	mvaenskae	i just totallz confused myself >.>
2015-08-02 15:49:40	Cheaterman	^^"
2015-08-02 15:49:45	Tatsh	but you won't get that in pure integer division, python will 'upgrade' the integer to float
2015-08-02 15:49:53	Cheaterman	doc235: A very good use of modulo is to transform time
2015-08-02 15:49:54	Tatsh	but in C you would get 1 (truncated)
2015-08-02 15:49:56	mvaenskae	Tatsh: WAT?!
2015-08-02 15:49:57	Tatsh	i mean 0
2015-08-02 15:50:18	Cheaterman	doc235: Say you have 135 seconds and you want minutes and seconds
2015-08-02 15:50:26	Tatsh	mvaenskae, what about what?
2015-08-02 15:50:26	Cheaterman	doc235: you'll use 135 % 60 as seconds count
2015-08-02 15:50:36	Cheaterman	doc235: 135 - 120, then modulo is 15
2015-08-02 15:50:40	mvaenskae	Tatsh: why promote without explicit casting?!
2015-08-02 15:50:40	Cheaterman	(120 being 2x60 right)
2015-08-02 15:50:46	Cheaterman	doc235: so it's 2 mins 15
2015-08-02 15:50:49	Tatsh	mvaenskae, because that's how python does numbers
2015-08-02 15:50:52	Tatsh	it always auto-upgrades
2015-08-02 15:51:03	Cheaterman	doc235: to get the 2 mins instead you'll do integer division
2015-08-02 15:51:09	Tatsh	python will go from 8-bit to 16-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit without telling you
2015-08-02 15:51:17	Cheaterman	doc235: because if you do 135 / 2. you get 67.5
2015-08-02 15:51:42	Tatsh	so in a sense, once you start to get above what python supports internally, you will get errors or rounding up with E-XXX
2015-08-02 15:51:44	Cheaterman	argh I'm doing the other way around
2015-08-02 15:51:55	Tatsh	and eventually you will just have 1E99999999999
2015-08-02 15:51:57	Cheaterman	doc235: 135 / 60. → 2.25
2015-08-02 15:52:15	+doc235	ok i get it
2015-08-02 15:52:17	Cheaterman	doc235: but 135 / 60 in python2 (or int(135 / 60) in Python3) will give you 2
2015-08-02 15:52:56	Tatsh	Cheaterman, you would divide 135 by 60, get 2, - 2 off the answer and multiply that against 60 ;p
2015-08-02 15:52:58	Cheaterman	so with '{}m{}s'.format(int(secs / 60), secs % 60) you get a proper secs → min-secs conversion doc235
2015-08-02 15:53:03	Tatsh	0.25 * 60 = 15
2015-08-02 15:53:18	Cheaterman	Tatsh: or you don't want to manipulate the initial number :-)
2015-08-02 15:53:25	mvaenskae	Tatsh: do you have any first hand experience with the m4800
2015-08-02 15:53:27	Cheaterman	anyways I'm just giving an example
2015-08-02 15:53:36	Tatsh	nope, haven't dealt with mobile CPUs in a long time

2015-08-21 23:04:58	catpigger	deathlire, see the references, full disclosure mail from 2014
2015-08-21 23:06:04	catpigger	and the CVE code has 2014 in it which is a little confusing to me
2015-08-21 23:06:15	deathlire	well it just went through my rss feed..just now getting public i guess..but it effects anything <2.2.0 and if you have it installed..as non ~amd64 it's v 1.5.x
2015-08-21 23:06:28	catpigger	full disclosure ML is public
2015-08-21 23:06:32	deathlire	all the cve codes have 2014 in them right now
2015-08-21 23:06:50	catpigger	and the fix went into git in feb 2014
2015-08-21 23:09:50	deathlire	can't be since v2.2.0 was only released in february 2015..
2015-08-21 23:10:02	catpigger	they link to the commit
2015-08-21 23:10:19	catpigger	maybe vlc didnt make a release including that commit since then

2015-08-21 23:11:52	catpigger	sometimes it takes a long time for things to make it into a release
2015-08-21 23:12:40	deathlire	yeah and just like if you don't have the ~amd64 keywords enabled your using 1.5x but it may not be vulnerable since it's gentoo
2015-08-21 23:13:09	catpigger	well im not using vlc at all i just find it curious that someone made a cve for that now
2015-08-21 23:13:59	deathlire	it was updated and it showed up on my new vulnerabilities rss feed is all.

2015-08-22 11:27:33	catpigger	wiktor_b, 1.8 is high by european standards, but its still quite low internationally

2015-08-22 11:27:46	Viperlin	as scotland is in the EU, their humans are europeans, so 100% of scots killed in scotland are killed by europeans

2015-08-22 11:46:05	catpigger	well he wasnt just any accounted. he counted the valuables they took of the jews and others
2015-08-22 11:46:26	catpigger	he also worked on the ramp where it was decided whether people were gassed immediately or not
2015-08-22 11:46:32	catpigger	*accountant

2015-08-22 12:53:19	+wiktor_b	right, but come on, hit a road?
2015-08-22 12:53:35	+wiktor_b	maybe in his last moments he thought "ah f it, I'm not going down alone", but eh
2015-08-22 12:53:50	+wiktor_b	the dude, meh

2015-08-22 12:56:27	+wiktor_b	is it just the pilot who died, or did 6 other people also die?
2015-08-22 12:56:42	Smiley	if not the road then where?
2015-08-22 12:56:48	catpigger	7 on the ground

2015-08-22 12:56:59	catpigger	plus 1 pilot

2015-08-22 12:58:16	eroen	they confused the grid cells in the pilot's brain
2015-08-22 12:58:16	Viperlin	chemtrails - he did a loop and breathed them in

2015-08-22 12:58:40	Smiley	hmmm
2015-08-22 12:58:51	Smiley	at that height there was screw all he could do to miss the road
2015-08-22 12:58:51	eroen	catpigger: it's pre gps, maybe they manipulate Omega
2015-08-22 12:59:05	catpigger	bbc reports the plane appeared to stall and he didnt eject
2015-08-22 12:59:10	Viperlin	Smiley: he could aim for the floor elsewhere
2015-08-22 12:59:19	Smiley	infact..... i recall something about stunt plioets using roads to tell them which way is 'up'
2015-08-22 12:59:30	Viperlin	catpigger: didn't eject coz needed to crash into a safe place to avoid other people dying?
2015-08-22 12:59:37	catpigger	Viperlin, dunno
2015-08-22 12:59:43	Viperlin	then target fixated on what he wanted to avoid?
2015-08-22 12:59:50	Viperlin	the rest is asplode
2015-08-22 12:59:50	catpigger	possible. maybe he thought he could still pull it up

2015-08-22 13:00:23	Smiley	indeed
2015-08-22 13:00:28	+wiktor_b	F he almost crashed into a house
2015-08-22 13:00:55	Smiley	someone i knew died like that
2015-08-22 13:00:58	Smiley	few years ago
2015-08-22 13:01:10	Smiley	he was a pretty good (said to be going pro) motox driver
2015-08-22 13:01:24	Smiley	(at least I think it was). Then their glider/plane crashed into a house :/
2015-08-22 13:01:25	catpigger	tbh this is a fail but security authorities for permitting such stunts next to an apparently quite busy road..
2015-08-22 13:02:09	eroen	Viperlin: it's raining Schutzstaffel?
2015-08-22 13:02:28	Smiley	catpigger: .... the wikipedia page kind of says it all
2015-08-22 13:02:32	Smiley	2 accidents in 8 years?
2015-08-22 13:02:38	Smiley	common... someone isn't doing their job
2015-08-22 13:02:47	catpigger	Smiley, does seem quite a lot
2015-08-22 13:03:00	Smiley	catpigger: concidering 1 747 crashes every 10? yes. it does
2015-08-22 13:03:02	catpigger	but its just speculation until the investigation is done
2015-08-22 13:03:13	+wiktor_b	maybe RAF pilots should be taking less cocaine
2015-08-22 13:03:14	Viperlin	2 accidents in a month*
2015-08-22 13:03:19	Viperlin	wiktor_b: or more?
2015-08-22 13:03:37	catpigger	wiktor_b, apparently he was a former RAF pilot and a current BA captain
2015-08-22 13:03:43	Viperlin	eroen: only 1
2015-08-22 13:03:49	+wiktor_b	less. then they could sleep more instead of doing crazy things
2015-08-22 13:03:52	catpigger	Viperlin, theres not 2 crashes involving 747s and fatalities a month ;)
2015-08-22 13:03:57	+wiktor_b	catpigger: even worse!
2015-08-22 13:03:57	eroen	Viperlin: half a Schutzstaffel
2015-08-22 13:04:11	Viperlin	catpigger: air show crashes :)

2015-08-22 13:16:43	Viperlin	if only they taught kids "don't crash" in school, this would never have happened
2015-08-22 13:17:38	catpigger	 Fortunately the building is understood to have been empty at the time as the children are still on their summer vacation.
2015-08-22 13:17:39	catpigger	Indeed locals say the school insisted the air show be held during the holidays to avoid precisely this kind of disaster.

2015-08-22 13:27:56	millerti	So, since I've had Gentoo Prefix since a few MacOS X releases back, it's completely wrecked.  Apparently, there are some hoops I can jump through to fix it, but it's just stupid.  So I'm trying to decide whether I should (a) install Gentoo Prefix fresh or (b) just switch to Homebrew.  Without starting a flamewar, can people give me honest feedback on this?  Gentoo is great when it's on top of Linux, but I've had loads of
2015-08-22 13:27:57	millerti	 problems with Prefix.
2015-08-22 13:28:18	catpigger	Viperlin, ah, that film is was talking about was 2006

2015-08-22 13:30:00	catpigger	i think the last german film i watched was "die wolke"
2015-08-22 13:30:26	catpigger	the cloud (of radiation after an NPP goes up. incidentally, thats the closest one to my current location ^^)

2015-08-22 18:52:17	chry	So it's ok if -j is defined in both?
2015-08-22 18:52:45	Poison[BLX]	well, if by 'ok' you mean 'able to bring even a fairly decent system to its knees'...
2015-08-22 18:53:24	dduffield	If you set --jobs in DEFAULT_OPTS, without any numbers after it, there is no limit.  Only dependency branches will be serial.
2015-08-22 18:53:37	chry	I mean my cpu starts burnin' even without parallel packages...
2015-08-22 18:53:39	dduffield	dependency nodes in a branch, the branches will run in parallel.
2015-08-22 18:54:05	Poison[BLX]	however, there's a --load-average option for both portage and make that allows you to reign it back in, without limiting *either* to less performance when one or the other is limited by something that has to run serially.
2015-08-22 18:54:32	dduffield	What does the load average float mean?
2015-08-22 18:54:39	dduffield	is 1=1 core at 100%?
2015-08-22 18:54:43	Poison[BLX]	floating point number
2015-08-22 18:54:51	dduffield	2=2 cores at 100%?
2015-08-22 18:55:06	chry	I'm not sure what number should I put in load average...
2015-08-22 18:55:17	chry	Like 0.20?
2015-08-22 18:55:26	Poison[BLX]	roughly, yes dduffield.
2015-08-22 18:55:43	Poison[BLX]	and chry: a good number, I've found at least, is number of cores +1
2015-08-22 18:55:48	dduffield	I'm thinking 4.0, possibility of running 2 cores at 200%
2015-08-22 18:56:24	chry	So my load average would be 3? For a dual core?
2015-08-22 18:56:25	Poison[BLX]	it's not actual utilization, it's number of processes active in a given timestep, average across a period of time.
2015-08-22 18:56:51	dduffield	do --jobs and/or --load-average modulate MAKEOPTS="-j#"?
2015-08-22 18:57:25	+tamiko	dduffield: No, they are tangential.
2015-08-22 18:57:47	dduffield	So --load-average modulates --jobs, but nothing modulates MAKEOPTS="-j#"?
2015-08-22 18:58:08	Poison[BLX]	make has its own --load-average option
2015-08-22 18:58:09	+tamiko	dduffield: MAKEOPTS="-j# -l#".
2015-08-22 18:58:13	Poison[BLX]	^
2015-08-22 18:58:21	dduffield	what does -l# do?
2015-08-22 18:58:34	chry	It's a load average...
2015-08-22 18:58:37	chry	I guess.
2015-08-22 18:58:40	dduffield	Ah.
2015-08-22 18:58:43	Poison[BLX]	Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are others jobs running and the load  average is at least load (a floating-point number).  With no argument, removes a previous load limit.
2015-08-22 18:58:48	Poison[BLX]	(man pages are fun)
2015-08-22 18:59:00	+tamiko	dduffield: At least ~4 years ago it was not so good to use MAKEOPTS="-l..." together with --load-average.

2015-08-22 19:01:05	Poison[BLX]	we might have to rethink this. fun pipe, really? you came up with that right at the start?
2015-08-22 19:01:20	chry	Haha
2015-08-22 19:01:36	chry	The first thing that crossed my mind...
2015-08-22 19:01:56	dduffield	I set -j2, --jobs, and --load-average 5.0 for a Core 2 Duo laptop.
2015-08-22 19:03:46	Poison[BLX]	I have -j4, --jobs, and *both* make & portage limited on a load average of 9 on my core2quad headless box, but I tend to abuse the crap out of that one anyhow (and would probably get the same or better out of it on a load average of 5).
2015-08-22 19:05:09	Poison[BLX]	of course, I also tend to run portage at niceness 15 and ionice'd down to idle.
2015-08-22 19:08:08	+tamiko	Poison[BLX]: The penalty for overloading the scheduler with tasks is not that high any more.
2015-08-22 19:08:59	+tamiko	Poison[BLX]: In fact, there is little difference in -j8 (ideal), -j9, -j20, -j100 in timing (e.g., to compile the linux kernel), provided you have that much RAM to deal with so many compilation tasks.
2015-08-22 19:11:11	Poison[BLX]	the ram's really one of the bigger reasons I have -j limited at 4 there, once it starts doing a few builds in parallel, it can add up.
2015-08-22 19:11:22	robink	Hello

2015-08-22 19:15:40	robink	tamiko: The latter patch is to the FPU emulation stack, which is probably not being used on most x86 systems (at least most x86_64 systems)
2015-08-22 19:15:51	robink	but the first one fixes issues that seem to be ones I was hitting earlier
2015-08-22 19:15:56	+tamiko	robink: The first one looks very promising.
2015-08-22 19:16:15	robink	tamiko: Indeed, hopefully it's a fix to both of our problems.  I'm running a kernel with it now, will keep you posted as to how it goes.
2015-08-22 19:16:24	robink	tamiko: On previous kernels, I'd experience a lockup within 24 hours without fail.
2015-08-22 19:16:40	robink	tamiko: So I've been running this kernel for about an hour, so I will let you know tomorrow evening (PDT)
2015-08-22 19:18:52	robink	Also, the bits after the rc7- version info in my kernel aren't really relevant to anyone else; I've got a couple of patches applied privately to mainline.

2015-08-22 21:31:54	robink	ephemer0l: but generally unless you've already marked out a subset of text that you want to address with your regexp, or you really absolutely have to change every single instance of ${pattern} to ${replacement}, you don't want to use g.

2015-08-22 22:11:04	robink	ephemer0l: because it gives you the option of running them on separate machines later, like I said.
2015-08-22 22:11:22	ephemer0l	and you can always dump postgress and move to a new box to import to core to run client server
2015-08-22 22:11:28	robink	ephemer0l: Otherwise, you've got this binary that always expects to launch a server, and you have to instruct it not to.

2015-08-22 23:15:38	Poison[BLX]	with absolutely no knowledge of the config you're doing, and just a general sense of what I've seen for that difference, it's possibly account name = local identifier to help *you* choose between accounts & user = username to authenticate with on the remote end.
2015-08-22 23:16:54	Poison[BLX]	also, if that random guess is right, it means I should probably spend less time around mail clients.
2015-08-22 23:18:09	robink	mek42: Erm, user would be the username.  Account name might be the equivalent if GECOS in /etc/passwd
2015-08-22 23:18:28	robink	mek42: as you might guess, it's been a while since I've set up a user in Quassel.

2015-08-22 23:37:26	+bonsaikitten	mjkr: the easiest way would be ssh, apart from that you could have a script 'outside' using signalling like inotify to respond when for example a file gets created in the chroot
2015-08-22 23:38:22	mjkr	bonsaikitten: maybe telnet on 127.0.0.1?

2015-08-22 23:38:59	mjkr	it's local loopback anyway
2015-08-22 23:39:04	mjkr	and it's within the same system
2015-08-22 23:39:07	robink	tamiko: 'cause that's sometimes the *only* way I get a log of a panic
2015-08-22 23:39:18	+bonsaikitten	mjkr: or the script that runs in the chroot exits, giving control back to the toplevel script
2015-08-22 23:39:23	robink	tamiko: I mean, serial console is better, but I don't have anything plugged into the serial port of my machine, and no IPMI card.
2015-08-22 23:39:49	+bonsaikitten	mjkr: for me it's about good habits - never do things that have questionable security and you never run into trouble later

2015-08-23 04:57:19	Cheaterman	Ah, well any THC is uber expensive in most of .de

2015-08-23 04:57:49	Cheaterman	Y'all rich so I guess it compensates hahaha
2015-08-23 04:58:00	catpiggest	Cheaterman, hm about the same price as coffeeshops in AMS, at least comparing 2015 .de with 2002 AMS
2015-08-23 04:58:18	Cheaterman	catpiggest: coffee shop pricing isn't a ref
2015-08-23 04:58:21	Cheaterman	street pricing is
2015-08-23 04:58:26	catpiggest	well, within a factor of 2 at least, hard to say
2015-08-23 04:58:38	catpiggest	yeah but there is no usable data on street pricing
2015-08-23 04:58:43	catpiggest	the stuff the police publishes is just BS
2015-08-23 04:58:52	catpiggest	and personal reports are anecdotes
2015-08-23 04:58:56	Cheaterman	Oh but I'm talking about what I buy as a person
2015-08-23 04:58:59	Cheaterman	Not any police data
2015-08-23 04:59:10	catpiggest	yeah, thats like my report, just an anecdote ;)
2015-08-23 04:59:17	catpiggest	thats why i use coffee shop prices as reference
2015-08-23 04:59:17	Cheaterman	True ^^
2015-08-23 04:59:36	Cheaterman	Coffee shop is about 50% more expensive than normal price
2015-08-23 04:59:43	catpiggest	in holland?
2015-08-23 04:59:46	Cheaterman	yes
2015-08-23 04:59:52	catpiggest	sounds reasonable
2015-08-23 05:00:10	Cheaterman	yeah it's okay, considering you have guarantees on the product quality & production chain
2015-08-23 05:00:13	catpiggest	given the extra costs, and assuming a low level of prosecution for people who sell weed outside coffeeshops
2015-08-23 05:00:23	+doc235	I wish they would legalize medical here in ohio US
2015-08-23 05:00:24	Cheaterman	OTOH, I know I can trust my friends who grow it at home
2015-08-23 05:00:37	catpiggest	doc235, republican lawmakers are calling for that now
2015-08-23 05:00:43	Cheaterman	Dokee, you're probably one of us in the best geographic and politic situation to see this happen
2015-08-23 05:00:55	Cheaterman	I mean, this will NOT happen in France anytime soon, while in USA some states already did it so...
2015-08-23 05:00:56	catpiggest	"do it yourself before that retarded electorate screws it up"
2015-08-23 05:01:05	catpiggest	Cheaterman, 19 or 23 states
2015-08-23 05:01:29	Cheaterman	thought it was 3
2015-08-23 05:01:37	Cheaterman	colorado california and some other
2015-08-23 05:01:40	catpiggest	the article i saw yesterday said 4 states (plus DC) legalised recreational, and 19 medical. im not sure if the 4 are included in the 19
2015-08-23 05:01:45	catpiggest	hm
2015-08-23 05:01:46	+doc235	23 states medical and 3 with the district of columbia (washington DC, USA)
2015-08-23 05:01:47	Cheaterman	Yes this ca	
2015-08-23 05:01:49	Cheaterman	4 states
2015-08-23 05:01:51	Cheaterman	Plus DC
2015-08-23 05:01:59	+doc235	ahh 4 :)
2015-08-23 05:02:01	catpiggest	Cheaterman, thats recreational
2015-08-23 05:02:11	Cheaterman	catpiggest: that's the use I officially make of it :/
2015-08-23 05:02:19	catpiggest	doc235, dont quote me on that. in fact never note quote randomers :D
2015-08-23 05:02:37	catpiggest	Cheaterman, me too, but i'd argue that it goes without saying that medical use has to be a priority
2015-08-23 05:02:43	Cheaterman	of course
2015-08-23 05:02:47	catpiggest	and, of course, medical weed is also a step on the way
2015-08-23 05:02:53	Cheaterman	yes :-)
2015-08-23 05:03:17	Cheaterman	but I'm not gonna be one of the guys who gets a fake paper from the doc
2015-08-23 05:03:21	+doc235	ohwait you are right colorado, washington, oregon and DC is recreational
2015-08-23 05:03:28	Cheaterman	yes dokee 4 :-)
2015-08-23 05:03:33	+doc235	cand alaska
2015-08-23 05:03:36	catpiggest	and we shouldnt deny that - nor the ultimate aim (of those who do want full legalisation) - even if the prohibitionists can then use that as an argument against us
2015-08-23 05:03:41	catpiggest	Cheaterman, i would XD
2015-08-23 05:03:50	Cheaterman	Alaska too??? well no wonder, there's hardly anything else to do there right

2015-08-23 05:38:12	Cheaterman	Me neither, I trust pip in general
2015-08-23 05:38:15	catpiggest	doc235, i've used pip a few times, never had a problem with it breaking stuff
2015-08-23 05:38:19	+doc235	I live on my computer, i can't have it out of commission :)
2015-08-23 05:38:26	Cheaterman	doc235: Same thing
2015-08-23 05:38:29	Cheaterman	And I still use pip everyday
2015-08-23 05:38:37	Cheaterman	So I think you shouldn't believe this nonsense you've been told >__>
2015-08-23 05:38:46	Cheaterman	If the software has been invented there's a good reason
2015-08-23 05:38:47	+doc235	ok ok, i will be sure to never run pip as root then :)
2015-08-23 05:38:53	catpiggest	and i do not recall ever hearing anything bad about pip. but then recall is not one of the strong skills of my brain XD
2015-08-23 05:38:59	Cheaterman	But how can you install packages if you run it as user, doc235
2015-08-23 05:39:05	+doc235	:/
2015-08-23 05:39:10	Cheaterman	pip is a package manager
2015-08-23 05:39:13	Cheaterman	Just don't worry
2015-08-23 05:39:14	catpiggest	Cheaterman, i think that was for me? well i only wanted it as user
2015-08-23 05:39:15	+doc235	oh
2015-08-23 05:39:22	Cheaterman	Trust me, if it breaks anything, I'll be here to rescue you
2015-08-23 05:39:30	Cheaterman	And I'll spend day and night working on your system if I have to
2015-08-23 05:39:32	Cheaterman	I promise
2015-08-23 05:39:43	Cheaterman	(and I'm 99.999% sure it won't break anything anyways)
2015-08-23 05:39:57	Cheaterman	so
2015-08-23 05:39:59	+doc235	worsat case is that i reinstall and rebuild but i have no backups this time :/
2015-08-23 05:40:01	catpiggest	Cheaterman, btw, i've decided to stick with pyqt after all for now. but "if" (ie. when) i hit the limits of that i'll go to kivy
2015-08-23 05:40:10	catpiggest	doc235, make backups. but you wont have to
2015-08-23 05:40:13	Cheaterman	doc235: If you're really worried, make a stage4 out of your current system and back it up
2015-08-23 05:40:14	redeyedman	Cheaterman: ok, can you made python funny for me?
2015-08-23 05:40:17	Cheaterman	But that's really overkill
2015-08-23 05:40:19	Cheaterman	redeyedman: yes
2015-08-23 05:40:39	+doc235	i don't know how to make a stage4
2015-08-23 05:40:42	Cheaterman	catpiggest: pyqt shouldn't be "more limited" than Kivy, except maybe for portability
2015-08-23 05:41:00	Cheaterman	doc235: it's like making a simple tarball of your current /, just you remove the unnecessary cruft first
2015-08-23 05:41:06	Cheaterman	Lemme find you the doc
2015-08-23 05:41:06	catpiggest	Cheaterman, portability is a big one, i'd really like to play my game on my phone ;)
2015-08-23 05:41:07	R0B_ROD	doc235: I think thats like tarballin the whole system and untaring it unto a new partition (???)
2015-08-23 05:41:23	Cheaterman	catpiggest: Kivy is here for that, I don't think you'll easily make a PyQT app work on Android
2015-08-23 05:41:29	catpiggest	Cheaterman, yep exactly
2015-08-23 05:41:31	Cheaterman	R0B_ROD: precisely
2015-08-23 05:41:37	Cheaterman	doc235: just wait a sec, gonna fetch the docs
2015-08-23 05:41:53	catpiggest	but what pyqt is great at is the "normal" parts of the UI. stuff like menus, settings dialogues, file open/close dialogues, and so on
2015-08-23 05:42:00	Cheaterman	doc235: http://www.gentoo-wiki.info/HOWTO_Custom_Stage4
2015-08-23 05:42:02	R0B_ROD	Im doing uclibc stage3 atm
2015-08-23 05:42:08	Cheaterman	catpiggest: But Kivy is sooo much better :/
2015-08-23 05:42:11	R0B_ROD	building kernel
2015-08-23 05:42:23	Cheaterman	Binding events/properties around, subclassing stuff as you need, etc
2015-08-23 05:42:29	catpiggest	Cheaterman, the selection of widgets is MUCH more limited though?
2015-08-23 05:42:39	catpiggest	i mean the ones that come with it
2015-08-23 05:42:41	Cheaterman	catpiggest: Yes, but that's because you don't need more as "primitives" for your own widgets
2015-08-23 05:42:55	Cheaterman	it's very very easy to make your own widgets and Kivy was architectured around that
2015-08-23 05:42:59	catpiggest	Cheaterman, yeah but with pyqt i can make file open in like 3 lines ;)
2015-08-23 05:43:08	Cheaterman	catpiggest: In Kivy it's a single liner
2015-08-23 05:43:20	Cheaterman	to make it open, automagically save a widget value, and load it on file reopen
2015-08-23 05:43:24	catpiggest	Cheaterman, i thought it doesnt have a widget?
2015-08-23 05:43:25	R0B_ROD	yeah of like 100 chars ...
2015-08-23 05:43:26	Cheaterman	on app reopen*
2015-08-23 05:43:28	catpiggest	no i mean the full thing
2015-08-23 05:43:34	Cheaterman	catpiggest: it has a ConfigParserProperty instead
2015-08-23 05:43:36	R0B_ROD	j/k dunno nothing about GUI code
2015-08-23 05:43:50	Cheaterman	catpiggest: oh there is a file picker widget :-)
2015-08-23 05:43:52	Cheaterman	don't worry

2015-08-23 05:44:35	Cheaterman	:P
2015-08-23 05:44:39	Cheaterman	Yes :D
2015-08-23 05:44:39	catpiggest	it even has the same name as in pyqt
2015-08-23 05:44:43	Cheaterman	Hahahahahha
2015-08-23 05:44:51	Cheaterman	And FileChooser too
2015-08-23 05:44:56	Cheaterman	if you need a simpler file chooser
2015-08-23 05:45:05	Cheaterman	So yeah
2015-08-23 05:45:19	catpiggest	hm and menu would be implemented using a drop down list i guess
2015-08-23 05:45:27	Cheaterman	Or whatever you see fit :-)
2015-08-23 05:45:38	Cheaterman	You could use a recycleview and have millions of items
2015-08-23 05:45:44	Cheaterman	it's really up to you
2015-08-23 05:46:07	catpiggest	i think i didnt make it past the layouts lol
2015-08-23 05:46:09	Cheaterman	Kivy is at the same time lower level and higher level than PyQT
2015-08-23 05:46:26	Cheaterman	So it's really worth it if you want both RAD and extreme flexibility
2015-08-23 05:46:34	Cheaterman	like, a power-user
2015-08-23 05:46:39	Cheaterman	like, a gentooist

2015-08-23 05:46:59	catpiggest	well i wanna write a game but im too lazy for the hard stuff
2015-08-23 05:47:04	Cheaterman	what hard stuff
2015-08-23 05:47:05	catpiggest	so yeah that should fit ;)
2015-08-23 05:47:11	Cheaterman	the first thing I did with Kivy was a Tetris
2015-08-23 05:47:11	catpiggest	any direct GL commands
2015-08-23 05:47:17	catpiggest	memory management
2015-08-23 05:47:18	R0B_ROD	I want to write a new OS but Im to lazy too ;)
2015-08-23 05:47:18	Cheaterman	and I didn't even know the library
2015-08-23 05:47:28	Cheaterman	catpiggest: Hahahaha in Kivy you have abstractions over direct GL
2015-08-23 05:47:37	Cheaterman	most of the time you won't even realize you're writing GL

2015-08-23 05:48:25	Cheaterman	been there done that ;-)
2015-08-23 05:48:42	catpiggest	well, i do wanna do some hard stuff. AI, complex game mechanics. i just dont wanna battle the computer ;)
2015-08-23 05:48:44	Cheaterman	very educative but nothing productive
2015-08-23 05:48:48	catpiggest	id rather battle my ideas
2015-08-23 05:48:55	Cheaterman	I made 4 apps in Kivy in less time than it took to make half of one in C++
2015-08-23 05:49:04	catpiggest	not surprised hehe
2015-08-23 05:49:15	Cheaterman	catpiggest: AI, complex game mechanics → I wrote a wrapper for Panda in Kivy
2015-08-23 05:49:18	catpiggest	and the C++ one probably had critical security bugs ;)
2015-08-23 05:49:21	Cheaterman	so you can use Kivy for the UI and Panda for the 3D graphics and AI
2015-08-23 05:49:31	Cheaterman	yeah that's possible
2015-08-23 05:49:39	Cheaterman	although it was so simple that I doubt it :/
2015-08-23 05:49:50	catpiggest	hehe
2015-08-23 05:49:56	catpiggest	i once wrote a c++-app

2015-08-23 05:50:08	catpiggest	only realised about half way through that i had to use c++ and not c
2015-08-23 05:50:19	Cheaterman	redeyedman: kewt
2015-08-23 05:50:26	catpiggest	so i tried changing "gcc" to "g++" and "filename.c" to "filename.cpp" and it worked. phew.
2015-08-23 05:50:59	Cheaterman	xD
2015-08-23 05:51:13	Cheaterman	Nah with Kivy it's more like magic
2015-08-23 05:51:14	Cheaterman	Like catpiggest
2015-08-23 05:51:28	Cheaterman	How many lines to open a window in Qt, with a button that takes all window and says "Hello, world!" ?
2015-08-23 05:51:40	R0B_ROD	oh lord
2015-08-23 05:51:43	Cheaterman	In PyQT of course
2015-08-23 05:51:49	catpiggest	Cheaterman, not sure
2015-08-23 05:51:55	Cheaterman	catpiggest: answer: too many
2015-08-23 05:52:06	catpiggest	Cheaterman, well, my answer is "not sure what the min is"

2015-08-23 05:52:19	catpiggest	maybe 2 or 3, really not sure
2015-08-23 05:52:22	Cheaterman	where would you put the imports :D
2015-08-23 05:52:34	catpiggest	well excl imports ;)
2015-08-23 05:52:37	catpiggest	imports dont count
2015-08-23 05:52:41	Cheaterman	Okay
2015-08-23 05:52:45	Cheaterman	In Kivy it's 4 lines
2015-08-23 05:53:07	catpiggest	but i think you can stick a button directly into the qmainwindow
2015-08-23 05:53:14	catpiggest	does the button have to do anything?
2015-08-23 05:53:19	Cheaterman	class MyApp(App):\n    def build(self):\n        return Button(text='Hello, world!')\nMyApp().run()
2015-08-23 05:53:33	Cheaterman	It has to show that it's pressed when it's pressed
2015-08-23 05:53:39	Cheaterman	visual feedback
2015-08-23 05:53:43	Cheaterman	other than that, nothing special
2015-08-23 05:53:54	catpiggest	ok visual feedback comes free
2015-08-23 05:54:39	Cheaterman	Yes
2015-08-23 05:54:46	redeyedman	what is MyApp().run() ? function method?
2015-08-23 05:54:53	Cheaterman	well
2015-08-23 05:55:00	Cheaterman	redeyedman: see the fisrt words
2015-08-23 05:55:03	Cheaterman	class MyApp(App):
2015-08-23 05:55:15	Cheaterman	you're subclassing App to create your own App type
2015-08-23 05:55:25	Cheaterman	Then you create it (MyApp()) then you run it (.run())

2015-08-23 05:59:39	Cheaterman	doc235: Well I see one, it'd make it easier for you to install/upgrade Kivy, as I said I can show you how to make Python funny ^__^

2015-08-23 06:00:21	Cheaterman	It's very funni GUI library ^__^ makes Python programming GUIs funny again
2015-08-23 06:00:39	Cheaterman	You could probably run it headless though, but that's not the point of it haha
2015-08-23 06:00:46	catpiggest	Cheaterman, it doesnt make it easier to install kivy.
2015-08-23 06:00:53	catpiggest	it makes it easier to install it off-distro
2015-08-23 06:01:02	Cheaterman	catpiggest: well, # pip install kivy
2015-08-23 06:01:03	redeyedman	^___^ it is magicka library
2015-08-23 06:01:04	catpiggest	emerge is still preferred if it has a sufficient version ;)

2015-08-23 06:02:12	catpiggest	with the accompanying disadvantages, like not being included in the main package manager's "update everything"

2015-08-23 06:06:00	Cheaterman	Above all imo it's a great way to experience the full power of Python, when you can program a software in an hour that will trigger your house's flaps or change the music in your home jukebox
2015-08-23 06:06:12	Cheaterman	all in the press of a button on your phone
2015-08-23 06:06:17	Cheaterman	You have a smartphone doc235 right?
2015-08-23 06:06:21	+doc235	don't have either
2015-08-23 06:06:27	Cheaterman	and yes you can emerge kivy, 1.9.0 is nice

2015-08-23 06:06:33	Cheaterman	Oh that's a smartphone
2015-08-23 06:06:42	+doc235	yes
2015-08-23 06:06:46	Cheaterman	Just you'd need some OSX VM/hardware to package for iOS
2015-08-23 06:07:00	Cheaterman	But you can package Kivy for your phone yes
2015-08-23 06:07:07	Cheaterman	Write once, run everywhere :-)

2015-08-23 06:08:49	Cheaterman	So he's not Jr because it's not strictly the same first name :D

2015-08-23 06:10:06	Cheaterman	That's a long way from Ohio!
2015-08-23 06:10:14	catpiggest	Cheaterman, is it possible to create a GUI with code rather than those funky text files?
2015-08-23 06:10:16	+doc235	my father american
2015-08-23 06:10:27	Cheaterman	catpiggest: Obviously! :D the text files are translated to code anyways
2015-08-23 06:10:28	redeyedman	mne is for me on the russian
2015-08-23 06:10:31	catpiggest	(and putting the text files into a literal string doesnt count)
2015-08-23 06:10:33	Cheaterman	so it's strictly the same thing
2015-08-23 06:10:33	catpiggest	Cheaterman, good
2015-08-23 06:10:48	catpiggest	well i dont really see how it would be possible to not allow code-based GUI creation
2015-08-23 06:10:50	Cheaterman	and yes, you can also put them in literal strings, and yes I understood that it's not what you want :P
2015-08-23 06:10:52	catpiggest	but what do i know ;)
2015-08-23 06:11:14	Cheaterman	IMO, the "funky text language" is one of the things that makes Kivy awesome
2015-08-23 06:11:16	catpiggest	this describing GUIs externally is not suitabel for my needs i dont think
2015-08-23 06:11:21	Cheaterman	because it's much less code to type for the same thing
2015-08-23 06:11:28	Cheaterman	I doubt it
2015-08-23 06:11:30	Cheaterman	Sincerely
2015-08-23 06:11:43	catpiggest	hm but large parts of the UI have to change all the time
2015-08-23 06:11:53	Cheaterman	Yes that's THE point of this funky language

2015-08-23 06:12:14	Cheaterman	You bind to Kivy properties, which make the changes affect your UI in real time
2015-08-23 06:12:20	Cheaterman	you can do it in code too, but it's an extra line
2015-08-23 06:12:21	Cheaterman	or several

2015-08-23 06:12:40	Cheaterman	ie
2015-08-23 06:12:43	catpiggest	well i suppose i can try the funky text thing
2015-08-23 06:12:48	Cheaterman	Label:\n    text: app.title
2015-08-23 06:12:49	Cheaterman	vs
2015-08-23 06:13:11	catpiggest	ah ok and then the label gets updated automatically when the value of app.title changes?
2015-08-23 06:13:15	Cheaterman	label = Label()\nself.bind(title=label.setter('text'))
2015-08-23 06:13:18	Cheaterman	Yes
2015-08-23 06:13:22	Cheaterman	In both cases
2015-08-23 06:13:27	Cheaterman	just less to type in the first case
2015-08-23 06:13:33	Cheaterman	but man
2015-08-23 06:13:35	catpiggest	ah ok
2015-08-23 06:13:36	Cheaterman	that's the WHOLE POINT of Kivy
2015-08-23 06:13:39	Cheaterman	realtime reaction to events
2015-08-23 06:13:40	catpiggest	didnt realise they are that tightly coupled
2015-08-23 06:13:54	catpiggest	i thought of these external descriptions as a totally or mostly static thing
2015-08-23 06:13:58	Cheaterman	extremely tightly coupled as they are all what we call "EventDispatchers"
2015-08-23 06:14:02	Cheaterman	so they dispatch events and react to them
2015-08-23 06:14:08	Cheaterman	Not at all!!!
2015-08-23 06:14:09	catpiggest	which is why i never gave them a chance so i never found out i was wrong ^^
2015-08-23 06:14:13	Cheaterman	Man x)
2015-08-23 06:14:16	Cheaterman	Really
2015-08-23 06:14:16	catpiggest	same with glade and qml
2015-08-23 06:14:19	catpiggest	(i assume)
2015-08-23 06:14:29	Cheaterman	QML is apparently the very same thing as Kivy, just less good
2015-08-23 06:14:35	Cheaterman	because probably more static as you said
2015-08-23 06:14:38	Cheaterman	I don't know
2015-08-23 06:14:43	Cheaterman	But it's probably not entirely static :)
2015-08-23 06:14:46	catpiggest	well i never really looked into it
2015-08-23 06:15:03	catpiggest	i tried to use glade once but i ended up taking the code it generated, cleaning it, and editing it directly lol
2015-08-23 06:15:09	Cheaterman	In any case, Kivy's event binding logic does wonders
2015-08-23 06:15:16	Cheaterman	You can bind to a value that's stored in a text file
2015-08-23 06:15:27	Cheaterman	and it'll load the file at startup and change your UI dynamically
2015-08-23 06:15:33	Cheaterman	and that's just one line of code
2015-08-23 06:15:38	Cheaterman	ConfigParserProperty()
2015-08-23 06:15:40	catpiggest	that does take away some boilerplate
2015-08-23 06:15:46	Cheaterman	So much boilerplate
2015-08-23 06:15:58	Cheaterman	while flexibility does remain because you can do what you want with the actual ConfigParser instance
2015-08-23 06:16:17	Cheaterman	It's just completely decoupled from your UI logic
2015-08-23 06:16:20	Cheaterman	the UI just "follows"
2015-08-23 06:16:27	Cheaterman	it's Kivy, it's MAGIC :D
2015-08-23 06:16:30	Cheaterman	that's what I always say :D
2015-08-23 06:17:08	Cheaterman	And yes, now that we have 1.9.0 in portage, it's acceptable to merge that
2015-08-23 06:17:21	Cheaterman	assuming latest Python works on it
2015-08-23 06:17:25	Cheaterman	Cython*

2015-08-23 07:06:17	+bonsaikitten	mkdir() is atomic
2015-08-23 07:07:03	catpiggest	he doesnt wanna create a directory though
2015-08-23 07:08:23	mjkr	ok. can "atomicity" be achieved in a shell script then?
2015-08-23 07:08:45	+bonsaikitten	mjkr: atomic means 'either it works or it doesn't'
2015-08-23 07:09:01	+bonsaikitten	mkdir is like that. cp isn't since another copy can clobber the target
2015-08-23 07:09:17	catpiggest	mjkr, you could launch the inotify into a new process and have that output to a file. after launching this the main script would check if the file exists and if not waits for the other process to create the file , and then waits for that to be filled with the "the file has been created" code
2015-08-23 07:09:30	catpiggest	seems ridiculously convoluted for such an obvious problem
2015-08-23 07:10:00	catpiggest	bonsaikitten, he doesnt need to copy a file either. he wants to know if it exists and if not wait until it is created

2015-08-23 07:11:50	catpiggest	1. register for notification. 2. check if file exists. if file exists kill the wait process, else wait for the wait process to finish
2015-08-23 07:12:18	catpiggest	thats the best i can think of having never used inotify
2015-08-23 07:14:04	mjkr	ok. so in the main script, I should first fork, -

2015-08-23 08:24:45	dduffield	there is no signature checking rsync currently.  Someone next to you (or at your ISP) could do an in-between on you and feed you a bad tree.

2015-08-23 08:26:39	dduffield	Cheaterman: Really, the best solution is to sign the top-level hash (take a hash of each ebuild in each category, then hash the category hashes, then sign this master hash) for a given tree revision.
2015-08-23 08:26:49	dduffield	That would make portage protocol-agnostic.
2015-08-23 08:27:02	dduffield	You could distribute portage over limewire, or freenet as a bunch of CHKs.
2015-08-23 08:27:09	Cheaterman	wiktor_b: So you were talking to dduffield

2015-08-23 08:27:40	dduffield	Except git is still vulnerable to he who has the Root CA's keys.  Fewer people have Gentoo's private GPG key...
2015-08-23 08:27:46	+wiktor_b	dduffield: limewire is just bittorrent, and a guy did bittorrent portage sync I think 2 or 3 years ago for GSoC
2015-08-23 08:27:47	Cheaterman	I mean once again you girigiri-safed out of my bl
2015-08-23 08:28:00	+wiktor_b	dduffield: git? root CAs?
2015-08-23 08:28:11	dduffield	I'm assuming you're talking about https.
2015-08-23 08:28:24	dduffield	Unless git doesn't use CAs.
2015-08-23 08:28:25	+wiktor_b	why would you git over https?
2015-08-23 08:28:48	+wiktor_b	you git over ssh
2015-08-23 08:29:14	+bonsaikitten	wiktor_b: most users won't
2015-08-23 08:29:23	+bonsaikitten	you git over http, because rsync is derp?
2015-08-23 08:29:26	 *	bonsaikitten no has understood
2015-08-23 08:29:27	+wiktor_b	also, commits are signed with gpg and the tree is hashed with sha-1, although that's only a consistency check
2015-08-23 08:29:49	+bonsaikitten	wiktor_b: and the gpg keys are protected how? ;)
2015-08-23 08:29:51	+wiktor_b	bonsaikitten: I think most people git over ssh
2015-08-23 08:29:53	dduffield	Ok, so I do "git clone REPO_URL," what are my protections that I'm pulling from who I say I'm pulling from, and I'm pulling what it says I'm suppost to be pulling?
2015-08-23 08:29:58	+bonsaikitten	wiktor_b: not for the gentoo case
2015-08-23 08:30:00	+wiktor_b	bonsaikitten: dunno, ask dduffield
2015-08-23 08:30:06	+wiktor_b	bonsaikitten: really?
2015-08-23 08:30:08	+bonsaikitten	dduffield: yeah, just trust dns
2015-08-23 08:30:08	Cheaterman	dduffield: None. Unplug from the internet now.
2015-08-23 08:30:43	+wiktor_b	dduffield: because you make sure REPO_URL points to a mirror accessible through ssh
2015-08-23 08:30:56	+wiktor_b	dduffield: also, what bonsaikitten said about DNS
2015-08-23 08:30:58	<════	mjkr (c7b4ffee@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.199.180.255.238) has quit (Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client)
2015-08-23 08:31:02	dduffield	What, they have an ssh socket sitting ready for anonymous connections?
2015-08-23 08:31:15	+wiktor_b	uh... yeah
2015-08-23 08:31:20	Cheaterman	That's... how git works
2015-08-23 08:31:31	dduffield	Yes DNS can't be trusted 100% either.  GPG signatures detect tampering by that.
2015-08-23 08:31:33	+wiktor_b	usually there's a user for git, hence "git clone git@wherever"
2015-08-23 08:31:55	 *	dduffield learns something new everyday!
2015-08-23 08:32:54	dduffield	If you rely on git, then you're relying on git.  To sunset git would require you to solve the security problem again.  Just use gpg signatures and drop in a small piece of logic in portage that checks that signature!
2015-08-23 08:33:16	+wiktor_b	bonsaikitten: I was wondering... see how commits to the tree are meant to be signed with gpg. What's the mechanism for revoking a compromised dev key?
2015-08-23 08:33:22	dduffield	Also you would be shoeboxing users who can't, or would rather not, use git.
2015-08-23 08:33:37	dduffield	Not that I'm one.
2015-08-23 08:33:49	+wiktor_b	dduffield: you can keep using the "old" method
2015-08-23 08:33:56	+bonsaikitten	wiktor_b: we'll think about it when we get there
2015-08-23 08:34:02	+wiktor_b	bonsaikitten: sweet
2015-08-23 08:34:03	dduffield	Yea, webrsync.
2015-08-23 08:34:11	+bonsaikitten	wiktor_b: some days I wonder why I even bother
2015-08-23 08:34:14	 *	wiktor_b compromises a bunch of dev keys
2015-08-23 08:35:10	 *	Cheaterman 's key is compromised!
2015-08-23 08:35:13	+wiktor_b	bonsaikitten: I mean let's say you've found out your key has been compromised no earlier than T. All your commits from t < T are fine, but any new commits signed with your old key need to be rejected
2015-08-23 08:35:32	+bonsaikitten	wiktor_b: subtly wrong
2015-08-23 08:35:35	+wiktor_b	also, all your commits since T but before detection need to be rejected
2015-08-23 08:35:38	+bonsaikitten	but good enough for a start
2015-08-23 08:35:43	dduffield	Wouldn't it make sense to have a "security officer" who has a copy of a revocation certificate generated ahead of time for each gpg key involved in signing the tree or other gentoo downloadables, so if a key became compromised or inaccessible then the officer just has to upload the corresponding revocation cert?
2015-08-23 08:35:50	mek42	if you're really concerned about security, leave the door open with a tracker, then counterhack and hire out to have them physically messed up a message
2015-08-23 08:35:51	+bonsaikitten	dduffield: eeeeeeeek.
2015-08-23 08:35:54	+wiktor_b	bonsaikitten: better than nothing, what's the subtlety?

2015-08-23 13:06:48	robink	Ahh
2015-08-23 13:07:07	dduffield	What would happen is the RAM would fill up, it would swap some, but it would act like it was going into very long loops of just burning the CPU.
2015-08-23 13:07:20	dduffield	Most of the time I'd have to REISUB.
2015-08-23 13:07:25	 *	robink is running 4.2.0-rc7-00128-gb7dec83
2015-08-23 13:07:32	robink	dduffield: Weird.
2015-08-23 13:07:36	robink	dduffield: What was occupying the RAM?
2015-08-23 13:07:40	dduffield	I tried with and without zswap.
2015-08-23 13:07:42	robink	dduffield: Filesystem/BIO cache?
2015-08-23 13:07:45	robink	dduffield: Userland?
2015-08-23 13:07:53	dduffield	PaleMoon, Xorg, tmux, vlc, lots of stuff
2015-08-23 13:07:57	robink	Weird
2015-08-23 13:07:58	dduffield	4GB RAM is easy to fill.
2015-08-23 13:08:01	dduffield	I use ZFS
2015-08-23 13:08:04	robink	Aha
2015-08-23 13:08:11	dduffield	My ZFS and my swap are on dmcrypt.
2015-08-23 13:08:13	 *	robink uses btrfs and usually doesn't fill up his 4GiB that fast.
2015-08-23 13:08:15	robink	Ahhh
2015-08-23 13:08:19	robink	Wow, swap on dmcrypt
2015-08-23 13:08:20	robink	Is that slow?
2015-08-23 13:08:25	dduffield	I have a set range for the ARC cache set on the boot line.
2015-08-23 13:08:30	robink	If you use AES as the symmetric algorithm, does your machine do hardware AES?
2015-08-23 13:08:32	dduffield	Not really.
2015-08-23 13:08:48	dduffield	I don't know.  I usually set blowfish or twofish, and grab a random key from urandom.
2015-08-23 13:09:10	dduffield	I have 32 Gigs of swap.
2015-08-23 13:09:51	dduffield	If I SIGSTOP a process, it'll go into swap nicely.  It's a poor-man's session manager for every app.
2015-08-23 13:10:14	dduffield	I have a keybind and script set up which gets the active X window and sends SIGSTOP and SIGCONT to the process that owns the window.
2015-08-23 13:10:28	Tatsh	is 5.13 the new version of KDE replacing 4.14.x?
2015-08-23 13:10:40	Tatsh	i didn't expect the KDE 5 update yet ;)

2015-08-23 13:12:15	dduffield	It's a tiling window manager, without any layout templates (awesomewm has layouts).
2015-08-23 13:13:00	Tatsh	well
2015-08-23 13:13:16	Tatsh	that's good, if you don't use Chromium

2015-09-20 02:12:54	Laurenzo	I've been reading the guides over and over again but I don't understand initramfs

2015-09-20 02:13:46	Laurenzo	why is it recommended in the guide, and in a way that require emerging sys-kernel-genkernel?
2015-09-20 02:13:50	tomboy64	Laurenzo: i usually boot without a bootloader (with uefi); and with grub2 it's hard to find a setup that it doesn't boot.
2015-09-20 02:14:15	Laurenzo	tomboy64: yeah.. well at least not in most cases. It seems like initramfs just proides some features that should be available at boot (mount custom filesystems and such)
2015-09-20 02:14:29	tomboy64	Laurenzo: genkernel is a way to get lazy/newbs up and running. you seriously want to use linux, learn to build your own kernel.
2015-09-20 02:14:35	+doc235	btw, that is the build log from network manager

2015-09-20 03:52:30	+Griz64	doc235, then you've got driver issues. tomboy64 has it right. you need to boot to the SysResCD, run an lsmod to see what drivers ARE installed and make sure they are enabled in YOUR kernel. me, i pipe the output of lsmod to a file in the root of /mnt/gentoo so i can then boot into the running install and verify things.

2015-09-20 06:28:13	tomboy64	moop: socks is a proxy protocol, just like http. usually you want socks5 or 5a, but 4 is also widespread.
2015-09-20 06:28:14	hosler	omg
2015-09-20 06:28:40	tomboy64	and it has zip to do with reverse-proxying.
2015-09-20 06:28:47	moop	ah
2015-09-20 06:28:49	moop	:(
2015-09-20 06:28:51	moop	welp
2015-09-20 06:29:01	tomboy64	hosler: what exactly is your setup?
2015-09-20 06:29:12	hosler	vps behind nat
2015-09-20 06:29:38	hosler	i want to be able to ssh to it just by giving domain name
2015-09-20 06:29:44	hosler	but it looks like that isnt possible
2015-09-20 06:29:45	patagonicus	Not sure if reverse proxying can even work with SSH. I think the only information you could use would be the username and even then I think it's only transferred after the host key has been verified.
2015-09-20 06:30:22	+lejonet	hosler: so what you actually want is to setup a .ssh/config entry for it or a DNS name for it?
2015-09-20 06:30:30	tomboy64	hosler: you would have to 1) enable your nat-router to be reachable by a dns name (possible), 2) port-forward into your ssh-box (possible)
2015-09-20 06:30:47	hosler	i can do all the port forwarding
2015-09-20 06:31:10	 *	lejonet has that for his IRC host
2015-09-20 06:31:17	hosler	what i really want is to have two services both running on the same port but distinquishableavarv by dns
2015-09-20 06:31:22	tomboy64	hosler: so it boils down to the dns-name
2015-09-20 06:31:26	tomboy64	ohhhhhh
2015-09-20 06:31:34	+lejonet	ssh to port 22 on the machine brings me to the host of the container, port 80 forwards it to the container :)
2015-09-20 06:31:48	tomboy64	now i understand you
2015-09-20 06:32:02	patagonicus	Yeah, I don't think the SSH client sends the DNS name it used to the server. How about different ports and entries in .ssh/config?
2015-09-20 06:32:04	catpiggest	hosler, http can do that. i dont think ssh can.
2015-09-20 06:32:11	hosler	ssh cant
2015-09-20 06:32:22	+lejonet	hosler: I snee, you want to something to "route" your SSH based on DNS name
2015-09-20 06:32:28	hosler	yeah
2015-09-20 06:32:31	catpiggest	if you have IPv6 you could use that and skip NATing
2015-09-20 06:32:37	hosler	no ipv6
2015-09-20 06:32:45	catpiggest	nothing routes on DNS name
2015-09-20 06:32:56	tomboy64	hosler: different ports are you only option, then, i'm afraid.
2015-09-20 06:33:06	hosler	:(
2015-09-20 06:33:08	hosler	oh well
2015-09-20 06:33:32	catpiggest	(you can do policy based routing, but that again requires something to automatically base the decision on, which ssh afaik doesnt provide)
2015-09-20 06:33:32	+lejonet	catpiggest: well if you have something listening on port 22 which does the "routing", you could, but that technically isn't really routing in the networking sense, more like intercept proxy
2015-09-20 06:33:52	hosler	lejonet: yeah i want that
2015-09-20 06:33:57	hosler	squid does that for httpd for me now
2015-09-20 06:34:11	catpiggest	yeah because http/s transmit the desired hostname
2015-09-20 06:34:11	+lejonet	I don't know of anything that can do that for SSH
2015-09-20 06:34:17	tomboy64	http is a totally different beast there
2015-09-20 06:34:20	+lejonet	Mhm

2015-09-20 06:34:43	+lejonet	The only "distinguisher" that I could see that SSH might provide is different keys :/
2015-09-20 06:34:59	hosler	ssh uses DNS
2015-09-20 06:35:10	hosler	UseDNS yes
2015-09-20 06:35:10	tomboy64	yes, that might actually be a way
2015-09-20 06:35:13	+lejonet	But even that I doubt SSH itself can use to do such thing
2015-09-20 06:35:45	+lejonet	hosler: yeah, for reverse lookup up of hosts and such, that doesn't mean the protocol uses DNS names or even sends DNS names as a part of its exchange
2015-09-20 06:35:45	patagonicus	hosler: UseDNS is for looking up the host name of the client.
2015-09-20 06:36:12	hosler	oh

2015-09-20 06:39:30	tomboy64	hosler: how about you have both log into one box, but immediately forward one connection, based on a certain key?
2015-09-20 06:39:52	hosler	ok
2015-09-20 06:40:09	tomboy64	the main problem is that DNS and ports work on different layers. you can't mix them.
2015-09-20 06:42:06	+lejonet	Mhm
2015-09-20 06:42:41	hosler	well they should fixthat for me
2015-09-20 06:44:26	catpiggest	hosler, people regularly ask for DNS-based routing. generally doesnt receive favourable reactions ;)
2015-09-20 06:45:15	+lejonet	in general because its a very bad idea :P
2015-09-20 06:45:16	hosler	yes i am currently equipping my flamethrower and about to go on a murerous rampage

2015-09-20 06:47:44	catpiggest	lejonet, might have something to do with it ;)
2015-09-20 06:48:00	catpiggest	hosler, yeah like that ^^
2015-09-20 06:48:11	mvaenskae	dns-based routing?
2015-09-20 06:48:24	hosler	dns based routing!
2015-09-20 06:48:30	hosler	why is it not a thing
2015-09-20 06:48:41	+lejonet	catpiggest: "might" :P
2015-09-20 06:48:55	+lejonet	hosler: because very few routers are capable of handling layer 7
2015-09-20 06:49:23	hosler	all we need to do is rewrite the tcp stack
2015-09-20 06:49:29	+lejonet	and you don't really want to add that to routers
2015-09-20 06:49:43	catpiggest	hosler, *IP
2015-09-20 06:50:05	+lejonet	hosler: if you manage to rewrite the network stack AND manage to get people to use your rewritten stack, then maybe we can talk about it :P
2015-09-20 06:50:31	hosler	ill do it tomorrow

2015-09-20 14:37:21	hosler	sure
2015-09-20 14:37:54	hosler	i was about to do tar cvjf /root/pi.tar.bz2 /mnt/gentoo
2015-09-20 14:38:21	MooingLemur	that will put /mnt/gentoo into the tar filenames I think
2015-09-20 14:38:27	MooingLemur	well, mnt/gentoo/...
2015-09-20 14:39:05	hosler	so your command works?
2015-09-20 14:39:07	MooingLemur	there's a tar option to specify base directory, or just as easy, just be in that directory
2015-09-20 14:39:26	MooingLemur	--one-file-system will not grab things mounted underneath (like /dev and /proc if they are)

2015-09-21 19:53:31	robink	I've not given up on the booze (in that I still occasionally drink alcohol), but I tend not to drink it to get drunk, because while I may not have even been full-on drunk, I've been sauced and it's really not that fun.
2015-09-21 19:53:46	robink	I mean I'm not going to say it was unpleasant or anything, but it really wasn't that exciting.
2015-09-21 19:54:29	robink	So getting drunk to the point where I've lost motor control (and probably one too many inhibitions), plus am at serious risk of horking and having to pee a bunch doesn't sound like a party.
2015-09-21 19:55:18	+Griz64	i HATE pukin'!!!
2015-09-21 19:55:24	+Griz64	ESPECIALLY on my shoes!
2015-09-21 19:55:32	robink	I mean I don't want to sound like a puritian (I'm not, at least when it comes to alcohol), but it sounds like at that point it isn't necessarily (just) the alcohol getting abused, it's the person drinking it.
2015-09-21 19:55:34	robink	Griz64: Yeah
2015-09-21 19:55:44	+Griz64	mainly cuz i'm in sandals most of the time, but it's all the same.
2015-09-21 19:57:05	+Griz64	i'm the same way. i love my Single Malt as UberPinguin and Neddy can atest to. I have one 'commercial' beer that i drink, a couple times a year, but getting drunk....nope. ain't happening. i'd rather take a puff or two, stay functional and keep on keepin' on.
2015-09-21 19:57:48	robink	Indeed.  I've not ...erm... puffed, but it sounds like a bunch better GABA agonist than alcohol.
2015-09-21 19:58:15	+Griz64	yupyup
2015-09-21 19:58:54	+Griz64	it relaxes my muscles enough where i can sleep (or work) and i don't lose my damned mind/inhibitions/control.

2015-10-02 03:23:32	+wiktor_b	it also depends on jurisdiction, but in most places only psychiatrists are allowed to prescribe drugs
2015-10-02 03:24:27	+wiktor_b	on the other hand, researchers are allowed to administer drugs but only as part of a study, not for treatment

2015-10-02 03:37:54	Cheaterman	okay so what's a psychotherapist vs a psychiatrist
2015-10-02 03:38:05	+wiktor_b	researchers just do research stuff just as you'd expect
2015-10-02 03:38:10	Cheaterman	yeah
2015-10-02 03:38:25	+wiktor_b	usually if you have mental health problem you'd see a therapist first
2015-10-02 03:38:48	Cheaterman	therapist is like the doctor and psychiatrist is like the pharmacologist?
2015-10-02 03:38:49	+wiktor_b	they'll do just about everything except for giving you drugs
2015-10-02 03:39:01	Cheaterman	like you see an eye therapist before seeing the guy that sells the glasses?
2015-10-02 03:39:13	+wiktor_b	well except for not being allowd to actually write prescriptions
2015-10-02 03:39:35	+wiktor_b	though I think in some places therapists are allowed to prescribe certain drugs, but that depends
2015-10-02 03:39:47	+wiktor_b	maybe in france it's different from uk and it's certainly different in the US
2015-10-02 03:40:12	Cheaterman	again let's just try and keep it simple, let's assume only doctors can prescribe medication
2015-10-02 03:40:17	+wiktor_b	a psychiatrist is just a doctor, they usually don't deal with therapy itself but manage the drug side of things
2015-10-02 03:40:26	Cheaterman	Oh.
2015-10-02 03:41:08	+wiktor_b	so for the milder mental health issues that don't require medication, you'd usually be cared for by a therapist
2015-10-02 03:41:37	Cheaterman	so if your health issue only needs medication you'll never see a therapist, OTOH whatever preliminary diagnosis you must have is generally done by a therapist right?
2015-10-02 03:41:53	+wiktor_b	some forms of depression, some behavioural issues, dealing with things like bereaverment etc
2015-10-02 03:42:06	Cheaterman	beaverment? like eating trees? :)
2015-10-02 03:42:19	+wiktor_b	no, like dealing with the death of a loved one
2015-10-02 03:42:26	Cheaterman	oh.
2015-10-02 03:42:56	+wiktor_b	well drugs alone usually do f all, so a psychiatrist would usually refer you to a therapist
2015-10-02 03:43:02	Cheaterman	wiktor_b: bereavement apparently
2015-10-02 03:43:05	Cheaterman	no second r
2015-10-02 03:43:16	+wiktor_b	typo :)
2015-10-02 03:43:34	Cheaterman	otherwise it's bevearment, and it means you start eating trees and doing barricades on rivers
2015-10-02 03:43:36	Cheaterman	:D
2015-10-02 03:43:42	Cheaterman	beaverment*
2015-10-02 03:43:53	+wiktor_b	but usually you'd see a therapist first, and a therapist might decide to refer you to a psychiatrist, or they can consult with your doctor to prescribe you drugs
2015-10-02 03:44:20	Cheaterman	I see
2015-10-02 03:44:31	+wiktor_b	or it might be that a doctor referst you to a therapist
2015-10-02 03:44:41	+wiktor_b	s/referst/refers/
2015-10-02 03:44:41	Cheaterman	generally speaking people don't interact with psychiatrists at all, and it's usually a language abuse?
2015-10-02 03:45:08	+wiktor_b	no, that depends, psychiatrists sometimes do some therapy work, but that depends on the case
2015-10-02 03:45:12	Cheaterman	or do psychiatrists also do consultations, which would more or less be like doing a psychologist's job?
2015-10-02 03:45:19	+wiktor_b	obviously they have to take a look at the patient
2015-10-02 03:45:47	+wiktor_b	psychiatrists do consultations but usually they're aimed at finding the right medication for you
2015-10-02 03:46:01	+wiktor_b	though they also do some diagnosis work that requires an MD diploma
2015-10-02 03:46:05	Cheaterman	man the new medicine my doctor gave me is dope, i'll be on my feet in no time
2015-10-02 03:46:22	Cheaterman	Okay
2015-10-02 03:46:49	+wiktor_b	basically, your usual doctor, a therapist, and a psychiatrist will work together if it's a tough case
2015-10-02 03:47:07	+wiktor_b	and they can still involve neurologists, psych nurses, etc
2015-10-02 03:47:24	Cheaterman	Okay I see, so as I mentioned when most people say psychiatrist what they usually mean is psychologist
2015-10-02 03:47:33	Cheaterman	or psychotherapist which is the same thing
2015-10-02 03:47:41	+wiktor_b	yeah you wouldn't go see a psychiatrist because you're feeling depressed
2015-10-02 03:47:50	Cheaterman	yeah
2015-10-02 03:47:50	+wiktor_b	usually you wouldn't go a psychiatrist unless referred
2015-10-02 03:48:19	Cheaterman	yeah I sort of get it, it's like any specialist actually, you go see a MD first, except that a psychologist is more adapted to mental health than a MD
2015-10-02 03:48:21	+wiktor_b	and it's not like a psychiatrist is a level 2 therapist
2015-10-02 03:48:31	+wiktor_b	they just do different things
2015-10-02 03:48:37	Cheaterman	no, they just do a different job
2015-10-02 03:48:38	Cheaterman	yeah
2015-10-02 03:49:28	+wiktor_b	and there's a lot of things they all do :)
2015-10-02 03:49:41	Cheaterman	in france you're not taken care of by social security if you don't see a MD first anyways, so it must be the same for psychiatrists, you would need to see a psychotherapist first

2015-10-02 03:50:46	Cheaterman	more stupidly though you need a prescription for medication refund
2015-10-02 03:50:56	Cheaterman	which kinda clogs the md waiting rooms
2015-10-02 03:51:07	+wiktor_b	they know what other health issues you have that could affect what medication you can take, things like that
2015-10-02 03:51:34	Cheaterman	yeah, I understand, that's also why when seeing any MD for the first time they ask for your previous practitioner

2015-10-02 03:54:31	Cheaterman	was it an issue he was supposed to be able to handle by himself?
2015-10-02 03:54:37	Cheaterman	they're not specialists
2015-10-02 03:54:47	Cheaterman	as the G says
2015-10-02 03:55:47	+wiktor_b	we'll see if we want to do anything about it and if so, what
2015-10-02 03:56:41	Cheaterman	well you just said he sent your dad's medical record to the appropriate specialist

2015-10-02 03:56:56	+wiktor_b	a bit late eh
2015-10-02 03:57:16	Cheaterman	quite more than that, but at least he's finally doing the right thing
2015-10-02 03:57:43	+wiktor_b	well, only because we drove my dad to a hospital to get his wound cleaned up, and the doctors at the hospital referred him to a mental hospital
2015-10-02 03:57:53	+wiktor_b	so yeah, he kinda didn't have a choice
2015-10-02 03:58:01	Cheaterman	I see...

2015-10-02 21:13:48	MooingLemur	robink: I think ** is quite valid syntax for exponentiation
2015-10-02 21:14:08	robink	MooingLemur: It is if you've been brain-damaged by Fortran (which I probably have, despite not having worked in it)
2015-10-02 21:14:17	MooingLemur	or use us-international layout and just say 10⁻³⁰
2015-10-02 21:14:34	MooingLemur	robink: it's perl's power operator too
2015-10-02 21:14:38	robink	MooingLemur: Haha, your superscript 3 is smaller than the 0 that follows it on my font
2015-10-02 21:14:39	MooingLemur	and ^ is bitwise xor

2015-10-02 21:19:31	inode33	MooingLemur: Remember that a 768bit prime was already factored.

2015-10-02 21:20:22	inode33	Like vanity onion addresses
2015-10-02 21:20:25	robink	inode33: I still haven't re-keyed according to the new gold standard for OpenPGP key management.
2015-10-02 21:20:27	robink	inode33: Hrm
2015-10-02 21:20:40	robink	inode33: You mean aim for certain n values or checksums?
2015-10-02 21:21:01	inode33	PGP keys that also can be interpreted as something else, like a jpg
2015-10-02 21:21:08	inode33	Yeah that.
2015-10-02 21:21:13	robink	inode33: Haha
2015-10-02 21:21:45	robink	inode33: I hope not, because that would imply that RSA (and probably DSA and ElGamal) had been thoroughly cracked.
2015-10-02 21:22:11	inode33	Doesn't have to be cracked if processing power keeps going up.
2015-10-02 21:22:19	robink	inode33: Er, maybe.
2015-10-02 21:22:30	robink	inode33: but you see the problem inherent with that.
2015-10-02 21:22:35	inode33	In that case you can just use a longer key
2015-10-02 21:22:47	robink	inode33: Hah
2015-10-02 21:23:18	MooingLemur	discrete log problem might have a novel general solution :)
2015-10-02 21:23:33	robink	inode33: You are always reducing the keyspace when aiming for a certain n value or hash, and if you can get a near computational equivalence between a key component or derivative and the key itself, then you assume someone else might be able to as well.
2015-10-02 21:24:03	inode33	No the idea is in the future we might be able to factor 1024 bit primes easily
2015-10-02 21:24:26	inode33	So a vanity key would be 1024 bits and a key designed to be usable would be larger.
2015-10-02 21:24:39	robink	inode33: Oh...?
2015-10-02 21:24:42	robink	inode33: I still don't get it.
2015-10-02 21:24:52	robink	inode33: I think I'd probably still go old-school and associate metadata with a regular key.
2015-10-02 21:25:17	MooingLemur	robink: he means not a key that's particularly useful for encryption anymore :P
2015-10-02 21:25:23	robink	MooingLemur: Oh
2015-10-02 21:25:28	MooingLemur	just a vanity key
2015-10-02 21:25:29	robink	MooingLemur: ...but that isn't a key?
2015-10-02 21:25:35	robink	MooingLemur: that's a vanity...hm...

2015-10-02 21:26:18	robink	MooingLemur: but as far as I'm concerned it's just a vanity nonce that happens to be something you can feed into a crypto algorithm.

2015-10-15 21:14:49	redcheckers	ah
2015-10-15 21:14:52	mystica555_	not post office protocol
2015-10-15 21:15:01	catpigger	but thats usually used for link providers, not hosting providers?
2015-10-15 21:15:06	redcheckers	i miss the post office having friendly cheerful employees
2015-10-15 21:15:20	mystica555_	catpigger: they have their own ARIN allocation; i consider them POPs
2015-10-15 21:15:22	redcheckers	catpigger: their website offers so many different options too
2015-10-15 21:15:38	mystica555_	and i know they do some fun vpn style inter-datacenter backboning too
2015-10-15 21:15:39	redcheckers	like they have openvz ddos protected vps, kvm vps storage vps, and web hosting
2015-10-15 21:15:45	catpigger	mystica555_, having own IP allocations doesnt make you a POP..
2015-10-15 21:15:55	catpigger	also companies arent POPs, they have them
2015-10-15 21:15:55	redcheckers	catpigger: they get their ips from ARIN

2015-10-20 22:15:13	robink	specing: Yeah, I know, but now I can more easily drive my Xonotic install with my Steam controller.
2015-10-20 22:15:36	robink	UberPinguin: The whole point of installing Steam on my Linux box ATM isn't to get at the games, but rather the Steam Controller userland driver.
2015-10-20 22:15:44	+UberPinguin	++
2015-10-20 22:16:02	+UberPinguin	I like to use it as a game management console, too
2015-10-20 22:16:42	robink	UberPinguin: The last Steam-distributed Linux game I installed, I used steamcmd to pull down the files, wrote a modification to the gamedata ebuild in /etc/portage/env, and merged from the downloaded Steam app directory.
2015-10-20 22:18:04	robink	UberPinguin: I mean the DRM is problematic, but I agreed to it.  What makes me bothered is that there's no 64-bit port of Steam or Source, plus the fact that they try to tightly couple it with a single distro.  This is the first time (after many attempts) I've managed to get Steam installed on Gentoo.
2015-10-20 22:18:28	robink	UberPinguin: My first successful attempt also landed it w/ a native runtime, but that was luck.
2015-10-20 22:19:09	robink	UberPinguin: It's like if I want to run a single Source-based game or use their controller, they're all "Ha ha, you have to install our DRM, good luck doing that on anything but Ubuntu!"
2015-10-20 22:20:13	robink	UberPinguin: So if they don't properly port the Steam client to Gentoo x86_64 (and maybe a few other archs), and/or open up the Steam client interfaces, I honestly hope someone completely REs the Steam Controller protocol and writes a split-out driver.
2015-10-20 22:20:29	robink	UberPinguin: Especially if all the firmware will ever do is emulate a mouse+WASD.

2015-10-20 22:46:17	_anomaly_	1) use a hex editor not parted or cfdisk which cause the kernel to re-read it - that messes things up.  2) don't alter the entries for said mounted partitions :P

2015-10-20 22:47:31	_anomaly_	then sync, remount ro, trigger rescan, remount rw, resize might work.. might
2015-10-20 22:47:53	_anomaly_	you probably need the fs driver to drop it entirely though
2015-10-20 22:47:59	_anomaly_	ie unmount

2015-10-23 16:43:45	mvaenskae	SpaceToast: mostly i was trying to get a proper layering of my wants on a secure base setup and there xen/grsec/pax would be of quite high interest
2015-10-23 16:43:48	SpaceToast	gonna have to talk with williamh or similar about what we could do with runit standards

2015-10-23 16:45:38	SpaceToast	but yeah, I can be quite slow (you can typically expect at least 4 things to happen in a month, usually more, but I have health stuff etc so sometimes I just literally need a full week of no work)
2015-10-23 16:46:03	SpaceToast	totally up for it if you're interested tho

2015-10-23 17:15:28	robink	Cheaterman: I'm more interested in Valve's movement on Linux support ATM, if we're talking "Game companies w/ proprietary game engines"

2015-10-23 17:17:12	SpaceToast	64 bit only really matters if you want to use a lotta ram
2015-10-23 17:17:15	Cheaterman	SC2 more :) that uses wine though as all Bli² games so far AFAIK
2015-10-23 17:17:35	SpaceToast	64-bit wine is discouraged in general ;)
2015-10-23 17:17:55	robink	SpaceToast: I thought you could chew on 64 bits of data at a time, not just address 2**64 bytes of memory.
2015-10-23 17:18:03	SpaceToast	well that too
2015-10-23 17:18:10	robink	Cheaterman: CS:GO is pretty sluggish for me.
2015-10-23 17:18:15	SpaceToast	but it's not that much of a difference when it comes to games
2015-10-23 17:18:30	robink	SpaceToast: That's a possibility, but I can't imagine the difference is insignificant.
2015-10-23 17:18:42	SpaceToast	it mostly is
2015-10-23 17:18:54	SpaceToast	games are typically reactive in terms of data
2015-10-23 17:18:55	robink	SpaceToast: It might be almost unnoticably minor, but there has to be some difference.
2015-10-23 17:18:58	SpaceToast	thing happened -> data changed
2015-10-23 17:19:09	robink	SpaceToast: Especially since you're still having to hook into a 32-bit userland if you need something to do the heavy lifting for you.
2015-10-23 17:19:12	SpaceToast	rather than active: data changes because we're doing stuff with it
2015-10-23 17:19:23	SpaceToast	that latter part is a problem, yes, but that's about it
2015-10-23 17:19:24	Cheaterman	robink: O__O what GPU? I have a Intel HD4K and it's playable
2015-10-23 17:19:33	Cheaterman	unless in huge deathmatch games with 20 players
2015-10-23 17:19:38	SpaceToast	Cheaterman: what's your CPU tho? :^)
2015-10-23 17:19:44	Cheaterman	SpaceToast: Ivy Bridge
2015-10-23 17:20:07	robink	SpaceToast: Now, granted, UltraSPARC was (is?) a *major* exception to that (32-bit code, as a rule, runs faster than 64-bit, and people only compile for the 64-bit ABI if they literally *need* the RAM), but I thought a good 64-bit architecture would provide a speed gain, provided the number of instructions per clockcycle remained relatively constant.
2015-10-23 17:20:17	robink	Cheaterman: AMD R7 (Kaveri)
2015-10-23 17:20:29	robink	Cheaterman: Newer, faster, more powerful AGP.

2015-10-23 17:22:51	SpaceToast	to be fair, intel drivers for linux are pretty godlike

2015-10-23 17:23:17	SpaceToast	robink: don't remember :)
2015-10-23 17:23:20	robink	SpaceToast: ilo will likely be the first F/LOSS graphics driver to support Vulkan, so that's a plus.
2015-10-23 17:23:27	SpaceToast	that too
2015-10-23 17:23:29	SpaceToast	thanks to valve
2015-10-23 17:23:33	robink	SpaceToast: i965 is the one that Intel has all their developers working on.  ilo is the one developed by LunarG.
2015-10-23 17:23:48	Cheaterman	Valve <3
2015-10-23 17:23:49	SpaceToast	pretty sure I used i965

2015-10-23 17:23:53	robink	SpaceToast: Ah
2015-10-23 17:23:57	robink	SpaceToast: The non-Gallium job.

2015-10-23 17:24:05	SpaceToast	does ilo run better than i965?
2015-10-23 17:24:15	Cheaterman	Valve was more like "m'kay Vulkan you said? let's make DotA2 use that before it's out"
2015-10-23 17:24:23	robink	SpaceToast: It usually lags behind by a tiny bit, but it's capable of much more than i965.

2015-10-24 20:45:54	arvut	Monkeh: wouldn't also the acid in itself make the fluid more slippery? so that it gets in where normal water would not?
2015-10-24 20:46:33	def3ctive	alcohol would get in great
2015-10-24 20:46:39	+Monkeh	arvut: I.. have no idea.

2015-10-24 20:47:04	arvut	true
2015-10-24 20:47:10	shadowdao	Ether or alcohol would clean things up.

2015-10-27 13:57:41	andoruh	what about this,  put the 15kg weight on one plate, and the wheat on the other, move some of the wheat over until they balance .. when they do balance that means that there is 17 1/2 kgs of wheat on one side and 2 1/2 kgs of wheat on the other, with the 15kg weight
2015-10-27 13:58:23	andoruh	split the difference between both plates?

2015-10-27 16:00:28	mvaenskae	so for my scenario where A logs in, then uses a terminal to log in as B and starts X programs B doesn't need any such file, right?
2015-10-27 16:00:35	mvaenskae	i use slim for logging in
2015-10-27 16:01:00	Cheaterman	well Xorg will use A's .Xdefaults

2015-10-27 16:02:30	mvaenskae	because i use one user to log in and manage local software installs and then have other users (like for studies and corresponding programs) then to which i log in via terminal and su

2015-10-27 16:02:52	mvaenskae	i quite like i3, very dynamic
2015-10-27 16:02:57	Cheaterman	so, no session manager, you probably need to xrdb manually
2015-10-27 16:03:09	Cheaterman	in your .xinitrc
2015-10-27 16:03:14	mvaenskae	it does apply .Xdefaults :)
2015-10-27 16:03:16	Cheaterman	or .xsession for slim maybe
2015-10-27 16:03:17	Cheaterman	ah good
2015-10-27 16:03:30	mvaenskae	i was just wondering if my other users needed it as well
2015-10-27 16:04:00	Cheaterman	if you start clients on the same server, no
2015-10-27 16:04:08	Cheaterman	if they open their own servers, might be necessary yes
2015-10-27 16:04:30	mvaenskae	same X server
2015-10-27 16:04:37	Cheaterman	then it should be OK :)

2015-10-27 21:52:10	robink	There will be more, I'm back on a standard spinning disk
2015-10-27 21:52:27	robink	Griz64: Not getting as in not understanding the gameplay mechanics, or not getting as in you aren't able to get it up and running?
2015-10-27 21:52:44	+Griz64	oh, i got it runnin', sorta
2015-10-27 21:52:55	robink	Griz64: I've never even played DOTA1, but from what I understand it's a military-structured RTS, and I've played my share of Starcraft.
2015-10-27 21:52:59	robink	Griz64: Neato.
2015-10-27 21:53:04	+Griz64	with the mouse, i can go up, left or right, but NOT down
2015-10-27 21:53:11	+Griz64	which really screws with movement
2015-10-27 21:53:13	robink	Griz64: Huh.
2015-10-27 21:53:21	robink	Griz64: I'd probably be using my schmancy new Steam Controller.
2015-10-27 21:53:31	+Griz64	don't have one
2015-10-27 21:53:47	robink	Griz64: Meh, not necessarily worth it.
2015-10-27 21:54:06	robink	Griz64: It's a really nice controller, but it's still a controller at the end of the day.
2015-10-27 21:54:15	robink	Griz64: and if you operate best with a keyboard/mouse, it probably won't be any better than that.
2015-10-27 21:54:33	robink	Griz64: If you are a game-controller-fixated PC gamer who has familiarity with touchpads, it might be worth a look.
2015-10-27 21:54:39	+Griz64	nope
2015-10-27 21:54:42	+Griz64	never used one
2015-10-27 21:54:43	robink	Griz64: Ah, well then.
2015-10-27 21:54:51	+Griz64	my hands are MUCH too large for that
2015-10-27 21:54:53	robink	Griz64: Neither have I (except once or twice at friends' houses)
2015-10-27 21:55:02	robink	Griz64: (or did you mean never used a touchpad?)
2015-10-27 21:55:03	robink	Griz64: Hm.
2015-10-27 21:55:24	+Griz64	the spread of my hand will go from A to past ENTER
2015-10-27 21:55:29	robink	Griz64: Ahh.
2015-10-27 21:55:30	+Griz64	and that's just ONE hand
2015-10-27 21:55:49	robink	Griz64: Well it won't make an enormous difference with the Steam Controller, but if you have long thumbs, that's a minor issue.
2015-10-27 21:55:51	+Griz64	and that's on my Fellows ergonomic keyboard
2015-10-27 21:56:26	robink	Griz64: Since the touchpads/joystick are nominally operated with the opposable digits, and the pinkie->index fingers man the triggers/bumpers/side-buttons.
2015-10-27 21:57:08	robink	Griz64: but if your whole hand is going to spill out and wrap up over the controller, that would make gameplay awkward, even with short thumbs.

2015-10-28 05:25:15	Cheaterman	me super as usual bliblibli
2015-10-28 05:26:12	Cheaterman	monk: you want something like route add 10.0.0.0/16 your_current_gw
2015-10-28 05:26:14	Cheaterman	then change default gw
2015-10-28 05:26:30	Cheaterman	change 10.x and mask to your needs
2015-10-28 05:26:55	+lejonet	Well, that doesn't really explain why the traffic to other VLANs get cut off
2015-10-28 05:26:55	+monk	lejonet, so on server A I want to route traffic through server B. I issue ip route del default; ip route add default via ip.of.server.B
2015-10-28 05:27:10	Cheaterman	lejonet: new gw cannot reach em
2015-10-28 05:27:22	Cheaterman	and you go through it so you cant either

2015-10-28 07:49:04	Milo-	FrostFeline everything we use is made in china, so I'd guess china has everything to do with everything.

2015-10-29 07:01:14	+iamben	i guess probably because they wanted to quickly hack it into place to do testing, w/o having to modify dozens of build systems
2015-10-29 07:02:15	+wiktor_b	probably
2015-10-29 07:02:41	+wiktor_b	also, they only really target openbsd and they don't really care much about other platforms using it
2015-10-29 07:03:05	+wiktor_b	seeing as it's an openbsd project they control the whole distro so they don't need to care

2015-10-29 11:14:56	+iamben	it's a sorta industrial park area so they are quite literally running new fiber TO us, explicitly FOR our site alone
2015-10-29 11:15:02	+lejonet	At the place I worked at before, we had an 1 Gbit line to our DC and used that as internet for the office (yeah I know...) and I think that for the actual Gbit connection we only paid like 100-150$/mo something, with SLAs guaranteed pipe and such

2015-10-29 11:26:34	+iamben	we sorta have "competition" here, I can get fiber from like 20 different companies, but it all comes in over AT&T's lines & equipment, and it all costs about the same

2015-10-29 11:58:12	jam3s2k1	your alignment might need to be checked
2015-10-29 11:58:15	salviadud	The rest of the stuff, hbo, cinemax, whatever, is on Conus, obviously.

2015-10-29 11:59:12	salviadud	So, the question remains, will spot beams be shortened out in texas
2015-10-29 12:00:03	jam3s2k1	the answer is no. the reason is that spotbeams are calibrated on earth before the satellite goes up and they are very rarely ever adjusted (only if a txp gets burned out)
2015-10-29 12:00:22	salviadud	Ok, so lucky me because I live right next to the border.

2015-10-29 12:00:54	salviadud	I doubt someone in central mexico can get signal on local spot beams, MAYBE on conus, but that woudl require some sorta custom dish.

2015-10-29 12:01:48	jam3s2k1	because we get so much traffic we regularly (almost nightly) move channels and markets between transponders to optimize usage and delivery. We could move your locals from one satellite to another

2015-10-31 18:23:33	robink	nebg: Not necessarily.
2015-10-31 18:23:51	robink	nebg: All you're (hopefully) guaranteed to get is a system with custom kernel configuration.
2015-10-31 18:24:51	robink	nebg: You can ensure that you've selected the most appropriate processor type, you can pass in compiler flags during the build process, you can disable features you don't use, and ensure that features you use often are compiled directly in, but there are never any guarantees that the resultant system will be "faster"
2015-10-31 18:26:09	robink	nebg: I currently run a kernel that's "slower" than an optimized build, because I compile the kernel image with debugging symbols (which are then copied and stripped out), which disables a number of optimizations, but I'd rather have it this way if the need to poke through a panic()ed kernel arises.

2015-10-31 18:28:35	robink	mek42: Ideally one with a RAID array.
2015-10-31 18:28:37	mek42	s/write/copy is maybe better language
2015-10-31 18:28:52	robink	mek42: Right, you have a serialized snapshot that you want to save.
2015-10-31 18:30:04	robink	mek42: I would attach a fileserver w/ an nfsv[34], CIFS/SMB[23], LIO-iSCSI-target and NBD services to your switch.
2015-10-31 18:30:13	robink	mek42: Make life a little simpler.
2015-10-31 18:31:18	SpaceToast	nebg: if you do customize your kernel, there's a good chance it'll end up SMALLER though, which should increase boot speed

2015-11-01 11:25:35	Cheaterman	Yeah, or you're just a lazy arse when it comes to socializing, as we pointed out before
2015-11-01 11:25:45	Cheaterman	Which seems to be confirmed by your presence here
2015-11-01 11:25:50	Cheaterman	You're a normal human being like us :P
2015-11-01 11:25:54	ASW	though some people in here said that because I don't need support I can't have it despite what I've officially been diagnosed with
2015-11-01 11:26:02	ASW	oh
2015-11-01 11:26:03	ASW	lol
2015-11-01 11:26:05	ASW	you were here
2015-11-01 11:26:09	Cheaterman	Yes :-)
2015-11-01 11:26:30	Cheaterman	Anyways don't hide yourself behind a syndrome, that's cowardice
2015-11-01 11:26:39	Cheaterman	And that added to your lazyness makes for a few flaws hehe
2015-11-01 11:26:44	Cheaterman	:D
2015-11-01 11:26:53	ASW	I'm not hiding.
2015-11-01 11:27:00	Cheaterman	Just have fun with us, we're all aspergers if that's what you wanna think hehehe
2015-11-01 11:27:09	Cheaterman	Or none of us is, including you :-)
2015-11-01 11:27:13	ASW	It's more like I'm annoyed that people don't understand and won't listen to me when I tell them what I need
2015-11-01 11:27:15	Cheaterman	whichever makes you more comfortable
2015-11-01 11:27:17	ASW	and they forget

2015-11-01 11:28:33	Cheaterman	ASW: you said so

2015-11-01 11:28:56	Cheaterman	doc235: a kinda hackish way to say IRL, which means In the Real Life
2015-11-01 11:29:21	renihs_	i never pointed out anything and i refute any such claims
2015-11-01 11:29:27	renihs_	also, the whatnow?
2015-11-01 11:29:39	Cheaterman	13:26 < ASW> To clairfy I can only interact with most of the world because I act.
2015-11-01 11:29:48	Cheaterman	ASW: ↑ would you deny you typed that?
2015-11-01 11:29:58	Cheaterman	if so your condition isn't aspergers, it's called being mythomaniac
2015-11-01 11:30:04	ASW	Well it's difficult to explain, but I used to act a lot more than I do now, I can't be bothered most of the time now, but some functions have become engrained, it's hard to tell them to turn off but they're not exactly me, and not exactly automatic like I always assumed NTs experienced them
2015-11-01 11:30:28	Cheaterman	renihs_: I could pull out more logs
2015-11-01 11:30:35	Cheaterman	but you all know I'm very good at this by now
2015-11-01 11:30:46	renihs_	nonsense
2015-11-01 11:30:48	Cheaterman	sure
2015-11-01 11:31:02	renihs_	like a drunken corgi puppy good? :p
2015-11-01 11:31:14	HedgeMage	ASW: That's par for the course for most not-neurotypical folks, regardless of why they aren't NT.  The mainstream tolerance for behavioral variation is pretty small unless you travel in rather specific circles, and making people uncomfortable repeatedly sucks.
2015-11-01 11:31:15	Cheaterman	ASW: well you're basically being a human being, and getting experience when it comes to social stuff
2015-11-01 11:31:22	Cheaterman	ASW: in short, nothing special there
2015-11-01 11:31:42	Cheaterman	maybe a bit late since you're 30ish you said, but why not, since you said you have a condition, makes sense that it'd take more time
2015-11-01 11:31:57	Cheaterman	at least it's very mild
2015-11-01 11:32:06	ASW	Yes, it is very mild
2015-11-01 11:32:09	Cheaterman	renihs_: DOGEEEEEEE :P
2015-11-01 11:32:16	Cheaterman	ah no it's not a corgi, it's a Shiba Inu, sorry :D
2015-11-01 11:32:27	HedgeMage	ASW: autism-spectrum, mental illnesses of several varieties, IQ outside the middle of the bell curve (low or high), culture gap, etc.
2015-11-01 11:32:57	Cheaterman	↑
2015-11-01 11:32:58	Cheaterman	that
2015-11-01 11:33:02	ASW	does not mean it's not there though and unfortunately because it's so mild it's frustrating when NTs see me as one way and constantly misunderstand me and assume despite me being very very clear with what I mean and how I am.
2015-11-01 11:33:06	Cheaterman	and many of us belong to at least one of these categories

2015-11-01 11:35:10	HedgeMage	I'm high-IQ enough for it to cause social problems when I don't act, and have a weird enough background to cause cultural/experiential disconnects with pretty much everybody.  I deal, and life is good.  I have an autism-spectrum son, and I hope some of my coping skills can be passed to him so he doesn't have to engineer totally from scratch.
2015-11-01 11:35:18	HedgeMage	Cheaterman: thanks :)

2015-11-01 11:36:42	ASW	HedgeMage, good to know there's others like me. Though I personally don't see the use in IQ, I mean intelligence isn't static and IQ doesnt' account for all types of intelligence imo

2015-11-01 11:37:46	HedgeMage	ASW: It doesn't...but it's a rough measure that's good for a narrow set of things.  In this case, it's slightly more polite than saying "I'm so much smarter than the vast majority of people I meet that I have to be cautious not to create situations that become socially awkward without intending to."

2015-11-01 11:39:09	Cheaterman	hahaha size 0
2015-11-01 11:39:15	ASW	I, for instance, am less emotional about things like "terrorism", more analytical and wanting it to end, so instead of saying, go blow them up, I say, figure out why they're like that, sort out the solutions and perhaps stop blowing them up?
2015-11-01 11:39:34	Cheaterman	ASW: that's not a lack of empathy, that's being lucid
2015-11-01 11:39:50	Cheaterman	at least imo
2015-11-01 11:40:01	ASW	Cheaterman, I meant emotional in the sense of OMG THEY KILLED OUR REPORTERS THEY MUST ALL DIE

2015-11-01 11:43:22	HedgeMage	FYI, a helo with no engine and a siezed gearbox is a ROCK...there is no bringnig it down gently.  There's crashing regularly, and crashing with fire.  Both kill you equally, though the latter looks cooler on TV.
2015-11-01 11:43:36	ASW	My Dad is a weird one though, I love SciFi, even if a lot of it is rubbish, but whenever I get super nerdy about some lore my Dad is like "you know it's not real, right?"

2015-11-01 11:45:49	HedgeMage	lol
2015-11-01 11:46:36	HedgeMage	Smiley: To be fair, they showed the blades rotating after the gearbox seized up, but if it seized in precisely the way described in character dialogue, they wouldn't have been.
2015-11-01 11:46:49	ASW	so HedgeMage you're a multipotentialite?
2015-11-01 11:47:39	Cheaterman	ASW: all philosophers are. and high IQ people are philosophers in general weither they like it or not
2015-11-01 11:47:43	HedgeMage	Smiley: The only way they keep rotating after that happens is if the...oh, I forget the name of the part...the bit that they can rotate forward but not back on independent of the motor is still intact.
2015-11-01 11:47:45	Cheaterman	philosopher meaning "who likes knowledge"
2015-11-01 11:48:08	HedgeMage	ASW: Yep, whether I like it or not.

2015-11-01 11:53:18	HedgeMage	FWIW, breaking into things is legit part of my job description.
2015-11-01 11:53:23	ASW	same, somewhat

2015-11-01 11:53:58	HedgeMage	Cheaterman: I <3 infosec, though I'm glad I'm not 100% pentester; I'd get bored.
2015-11-01 11:54:02	ASW	I got frustrated with the small computer work experience and everyone around me who wouldn't listen to me
2015-11-01 11:54:31	ASW	I'm not one for heirarchy, I legitimately don't see anyone as more or less important than myself

2015-11-01 11:55:14	Cheaterman	Yeah, it's actually the reason I'm using Gentoo Hardened, it's meant to be my "pentest" distro as well as my everyday one
2015-11-01 11:55:25	 *	HedgeMage nods.
2015-11-01 11:55:28	Cheaterman	Gentoo Hardened + pentoo overlay, although I didn't install anything from it yet
2015-11-01 11:55:31	Smiley	Cheaterman: Long nap earlier today most likely
2015-11-01 11:55:36	ASW	Cheaterman, was it you talking about people using Kali?

2015-11-01 11:55:55	Cheaterman	ASW: yes :-)

2015-11-01 11:56:09	HedgeMage	Yeah, I'm trying to migrate to hardened, but I'm still in the progress of moving my SELinux stuff to grsec, and doing the prefabbed grsec stuff or learning mode is not okay for some of my environments.
2015-11-01 11:56:21	ASW	Yeah, I don't Kali, it seems such a stupid idea to have root automatically on a pentest system
2015-11-01 11:56:38	Cheaterman	HedgeMage: I don't even use SELinux or grsec or PaX
2015-11-01 11:56:40	ASW	don't get*
2015-11-01 11:56:42	HedgeMage	ASW: Kali is for people who want to pentest but are too dumb to install things.

2015-11-01 11:56:51	Cheaterman	and don't mind getting hacked back
2015-11-01 11:56:53	ASW	Lol, HedgeMage
2015-11-01 11:57:12	ASW	HedgeMage, I'm starting on Hardened too
2015-11-01 11:57:26	ASW	really getting into privacy/security recently, because it's interesting
2015-11-01 11:57:33	Smiley	i love security
2015-11-01 11:57:35	Cheaterman	She could help you with grsec/SELinux apparently - I cannot
2015-11-01 11:57:37	HedgeMage	Cheaterman: then why bother with Hardened?  It's easy enough to pie/pax without it.
2015-11-01 11:57:39	Smiley	pffft to privacy tho
2015-11-01 11:57:43	Smiley	I think that's all a lie to start wit :D
2015-11-01 11:57:47	ASW	Not using Pax or anything yet though, will do when I figure out its niggles
2015-11-01 11:58:02	Cheaterman	HedgeMage: the other way around - hardened is really easy to live with :-)
2015-11-01 11:58:08	Cheaterman	while grsec is not for instance
2015-11-01 11:58:25	HedgeMage	Cheaterman: Agreed.  I was wondering what the point of Hardened without grsec/selinux was, though.
2015-11-01 11:58:48	HedgeMage	Cheaterman: I was under the impression that it was just a cocktail of pie/pax and your choice of grsec/selinux/apparmor ?
2015-11-01 11:58:54	ASW	Newer stable kernel :p
2015-11-01 11:58:55	Cheaterman	well, honestly, I don't know, but I feel safer, and even script kiddie exploits don't work on my system, so I assume even lower level ones don't
2015-11-01 11:59:15	HedgeMage	lol okay
2015-11-01 11:59:20	Cheaterman	HedgeMage: imo it's more about the kernel patches - I use hardened-sources - and the package/USE masking for things that are unsafe?
2015-11-01 11:59:24	+lejonet	HedgeMage: PAX has quite some passive ramifications on the kernel, like consting all kinds of things to reduce attack surfaces
2015-11-01 11:59:32	Cheaterman	HedgeMage: OTOH I have prelink installed for wine here
2015-11-01 11:59:58	HedgeMage	lejonet: Right, but one doesn't have to use the hardened profile to use the hardened sources...I was curious about what exactly was so cool about the profile.
2015-11-01 12:00:07	Cheaterman	HedgeMage: I call it hardened, but it's really just a hardened profile with hardened sources
2015-11-01 12:00:11	Cheaterman	but that should be more than sufficient :)
2015-11-01 12:00:20	+lejonet	And plugins for GCC with stuff like stackleak, constify and similar protections, which is applied passively to all binaries if you use the hardened profile, and thus a hardened toolchain
2015-11-01 12:00:31	HedgeMage	lejonet: one can use pax+hardened-sources on any profile
2015-11-01 12:00:41	Cheaterman	lejonet: oh nice
2015-11-01 12:00:49	HedgeMage	Ahh, I wasn't aware of the GCC plugins...that sounds worth having.
2015-11-01 12:00:51	+lejonet	HedgeMage: very true, but that isn't all the hardened profile is about :)
2015-11-01 12:00:53	Cheaterman	didn't know that
2015-11-01 12:00:57	Cheaterman	yeah it seems to kick a$$$
2015-11-01 12:00:58	ASW	lejonet, I'd use PaX but my games don't work and I'm new to it so I've disabled it for now
2015-11-01 12:00:59	HedgeMage	lejonet: that's what I was trying to find out.
2015-11-01 12:01:13	Smiley	urgh
2015-11-01 12:01:15	+lejonet	Sure, the gcc plugins are "tied" to the kernel, but they are only used, by default, with the hardened toolchain
2015-11-01 12:01:31	+lejonet	ASW: hehe yeah, it takes some getting used too :)
2015-11-01 12:01:57	ASW	lejonet, I did try setting -m on steam but it didn't work, so I gave up with Pax after that
2015-11-01 12:01:59	HedgeMage	lejonet: TBH, I've stayed away from hardened because the docs are pretty poor, so I've been concerned about ending up in situations I don't really have time to troubleshoot because I'm not entirely sure what I'd be getting with that profile.
2015-11-01 12:02:04	ASW	will try it again in the future though
2015-11-01 12:02:21	+lejonet	HedgeMage: what docs are poor you'd say?
2015-11-01 12:02:21	HedgeMage	lejonet: Or, worse...having some godsawful stuff like systemd dragged into my world!
2015-11-01 12:02:29	ASW	HedgeMage, I completely agree, the docs are poor
2015-11-01 12:02:40	ASW	if I figure it out I'm going to help rewrite them
2015-11-01 12:02:47	Cheaterman	HedgeMage: it really doesn't ned that much mmore documentation
2015-11-01 12:02:48	+lejonet	ASW: hehe, yeah, just disabling mprotect usually isn't enough for a more complex binary
2015-11-01 12:02:49	Cheaterman	i mean, it just works
2015-11-01 12:02:51	Smiley	lejonet: it's STILL going lol
2015-11-01 12:02:57	+lejonet	Smiley: the fsck? Lol

2015-11-01 12:03:25	+lejonet	HedgeMage: Well sure, I am in the hardened team afterall, so some use I should do :P
2015-11-01 12:03:42	Cheaterman	lejonet: good job so far :)
2015-11-01 12:03:47	Cheaterman	i just had to unmask prelink for wine
2015-11-01 12:03:58	Cheaterman	oh also there's some obsolete anti-nvidia masks
2015-11-01 12:03:59	+lejonet	Cheaterman: I can't take much credit, been very inactive the past few years :P
2015-11-01 12:04:03	HedgeMage	lejonet: I do recall that the wiki docs didn't immediately tell me everything that I would get by using hardened profile.  I suspect it's at least in part stuff I do manually and would like in a sane package, but any part of it being unknown is NOT OKAY.
2015-11-01 12:04:04	Cheaterman	at least in amd64 hardened

2015-11-01 12:18:35	ASW	Females should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, but OTOH their bodies are often exploited and objectified in order to sell things. It just makes me uncomfortable to see that kind of thing for various reasons. I am very sex positive but it does then make some people think that female bodies are up for grabs if they do/buy/say certain things, and I'm honestly for reducing that kind of behaviour
2015-11-01 12:18:47	HedgeMage	You don't get blamed as long as I get to quietly assume it's a personal compliment paid to whatever bits I was feeling self-conscious about previously.

2015-11-01 15:40:14	HedgeMage	ASW: I've taught LF not to be as well.  As a matter of fact, I once got a fun call from his school...
2015-11-01 15:41:20	HedgeMage	ASW: They'd had the police in for some sort of "citizenship assembly" when he was in 2nd grade or so.  LF is speech impaired, so I never got 100% of the story of what set him off (the teachers were no more helpful in relating it than he was), but at some point during a scene the cop had asked him to help role play...
2015-11-01 15:41:48	ASW	I listen to a podcast called Tangentially Speaking and the host is always talking about how America is compared to somewhere like say Spain. America is very black and white when it comes to the public and law a lot of the time whereas in Spain the cops are relaxed and don't care if you park somewhere you're not officially supposed to or grow cannabis unless someone complains.
2015-11-01 15:42:09	HedgeMage	ASW: LF puts up both his hands, takes two steps back, and starts repeating "I'm sorry, but I'm not comfortable talking to you any more.  I'm a minor, and you can't ask me any questions until my mom gets here.  Her name is XXX and her phone number is XXX."
2015-11-01 15:42:48	ASW	Oooo, that's funny and awesome imo
2015-11-01 15:42:53	HedgeMage	Apparently, this made the school and the police concerned about what I'd been teaching him.  I simply said "civil rights and due process".

2015-11-02 18:00:32	+Griz64	iamben, i saw you speaking with someone about 'gcheck'. just out of curiousity, i ran 'gcheck vlc'. the final line is:    * 492 out of 498 files are good    my question is, should i be concerned??
2015-11-02 18:00:45	+Griz64	(sigh)
2015-11-02 18:00:52	+Griz64	s/gcheck/qcheck
2015-11-02 18:02:09	+iamben	Griz64: depends on what files are "bad", try using -P with qcheck which makes it ignore CONFIG_PROTECT files (which are configs that you are likely to modify yourself)
2015-11-02 18:02:47	+iamben	there are a few other possible causes of false-positives
2015-11-02 18:03:14	+Griz64	iamben, http://dpaste.com/0KHN150.txt
2015-11-02 18:04:26	+iamben	Griz64: it's normal for plugins.dat from vlc to show up as 'bad' but i dont know why any others would be bad
2015-11-02 18:04:29	+Griz64	and will it make a difference, running it as an unprivileged user, vice root?
2015-11-02 18:04:44	+iamben	plugins.dat is a file that gets generated/updated after the inital emerge so it will have a different checksum
2015-11-02 18:05:07	+iamben	Griz64: in some cases it will matter, if the files are not readable by normal users... but i dont think that applies to these vlc things
2015-11-02 18:05:30	+Griz64	it didn't. i tried it as root, with the same output/results.

2015-11-02 18:20:23	+Griz64	iamben, should i pipe the output to a file??

2015-11-08 02:43:04	appels	Is it possible I just have network manager in the installation
2015-11-08 02:43:11	appels	and that I use that for connecting
2015-11-08 02:43:19	appels	or did i just get everything wrong
2015-11-08 02:44:55	+doc235	I have a laptop on wpa_supplicant, a notebook and networkmanager and my desktop on dhcpcd
2015-11-08 02:46:19	appels	so will it just work?

2015-11-08 02:46:28	appels	(well, will it probably work)
2015-11-08 02:47:45	+doc235	no idea. i don't recallho2w i did it
2015-11-08 02:48:05	+doc235	i would have to go fire them up and find which one of 4 and then get the info
2015-11-08 02:48:07	+doc235	BUT
2015-11-08 02:48:23	+doc235	i am smoking and will most likely not do those things :)
2015-11-08 02:50:18	appels	well, I still think it's weird how the livecd can just connect to the internet like most normal thing in the world
2015-11-08 02:50:34	appels	but that I need to set it up twice according to some ppl
2015-11-08 02:50:50	appels	Why can't I just have that magic in my installation itself too?
2015-11-08 02:50:58	+doc235	my point was that you could use any of the choices
2015-11-08 02:51:02	+doc235	i mix them up
2015-11-08 02:51:07	+doc235	depends what works
2015-11-08 02:51:16	appels	well, I'm going for a thing that isn't mentioned in the manual
2015-11-08 02:51:30	appels	I want to have the same functionality as I have now
2015-11-08 02:51:42	appels	but I'm not sure if the wicd network manager will work or not
2015-11-08 02:51:59	appels	like, if it needs some kind of special underlaying thing
2015-11-08 02:52:07	appels	that doesnt come with wicd
2015-11-08 02:52:07	+doc235	wicd is deprecated i believe
2015-11-08 02:52:36	appels	well, what if I use the NetworkManager Applet then?
2015-11-08 02:52:46	appels	(which is basically the same as wicd, but only GUI i heard)
2015-11-08 02:53:40	+doc235	nmgui, nmtui, networkmanager in x
2015-11-08 02:53:55	+doc235	i use nmtui to install with
2015-11-08 02:54:35	appels	wait a second *I'm sorry if I interrupt you*, but this is weird
2015-11-08 02:54:59	appels	Why would I need to configure networking at the beginning in all those weird ways,
2015-11-08 02:55:08	appels	if I can just get the network manager packages
2015-11-08 02:55:12	+doc235	no idea
2015-11-08 02:55:16	appels	and install them later from my usb
2015-11-08 02:55:21	+doc235	you asked how i doi it
2015-11-08 02:55:32	+doc235	once configured it is done
2015-11-08 02:55:40	appels	yeah :P I'm a bit confused about networking, but I hope that I got it right now
2015-11-08 02:55:55	+hosler	appels: install it all in livecd
2015-11-08 02:56:01	appels	also the fact that the network manager homepage says:
2015-11-08 02:56:04	appels	"NetworkManager is a set of co-operative tools that make networking simple and straightforward. Whether Wi-Fi, wired, bond, bridge, 3G, or Bluetooth,"
2015-11-08 02:56:10	+hosler	stage3 then kernel then any other packages you want
2015-11-08 02:56:50	appels	well, how do i install the package already then? do i first need to move on to the next installation step already?
2015-11-08 02:57:04	appels	because i dont know _when_ to install networkmanager in that case
2015-11-08 02:57:13	appels	or more specifically: how

2015-11-09 06:14:40	nebg	hello everyone... which is the proper file on which i can store user aliases ?
2015-11-09 06:15:50	+lejonet	nebg: user aliases?
2015-11-09 06:16:12	nebg	user aliases... like MYALIAS=emerge --sync
2015-11-09 06:16:28	nebg	is it in ~/.profile or in ~/.bashrc ?

2015-11-09 06:18:40	+lejonet	ah, that would be in .bashrc if you use bash, .zshrc for zsh, all in all, it depends on what shell you use (but by default you got bash=
2015-11-09 06:18:43	+lejonet	)*
2015-11-09 06:20:08	SpaceToast	^
2015-11-09 06:20:41	SpaceToast	in zsh it should be `alias MYALIAS="emerge --sync"`
2015-11-09 06:20:54	+lejonet	SpaceToast: even in bash, that is the syntax
2015-11-09 06:20:58	SpaceToast	(with a -g if you want to be able to && MYALIAS and similar, but that's typically not the case)
2015-11-09 06:21:16	SpaceToast	ok lejonet , it's been a while since I used aliases in bash, though pretty sure alias -g isn't a thing in bas
2015-11-09 06:21:31	+lejonet	SpaceToast: that I dunno, I've never used anything but the basic
2015-11-09 06:21:33	+lejonet	xD*
2015-11-09 06:21:36	SpaceToast	;)
2015-11-09 06:21:57	+lejonet	just having MYALIAS="emerge --sync" would be a local variable only
2015-11-09 06:22:15	SpaceToast	yeah
2015-11-09 06:22:18	SpaceToast	(and not an alias)
2015-11-09 06:22:37	+doc235	i have no clue how to use aliases
2015-11-09 06:22:57	+lejonet	doc235: do alias nano='vim' in a shell and try to use nano :P
2015-11-09 06:23:07	+doc235	I actually have little clue on how to use gentoo and linux in general
2015-11-09 06:23:20	nebg	SpaceToast, lejonet isn't there any shell independent config file ? what's .profile ?
2015-11-09 06:23:25	+doc235	noooooo i no want vim :)
2015-11-09 06:23:41	+lejonet	nebg: not that I know off, as they way aliases is implemented, is shell dependent
2015-11-09 06:23:56	+lejonet	some shells might not even have that, or call it by something completely else, like in fish
2015-11-09 06:24:10	SpaceToast	nebg: .profile is bash specific (instead of bash_profile)
2015-11-09 06:24:11	stressfactor	nebg i think /etc/profile may be what your looking for

2015-11-09 06:26:22	nebg	you mean by using a .profile ?
2015-11-09 06:26:28	SpaceToast	no.
2015-11-09 06:26:38	SpaceToast	/etc/profile.d, see above
2015-11-09 06:26:45	SpaceToast	nebg: I'd recommend just doing stuff per-shell though
2015-11-09 06:27:13	SpaceToast	aliases are typically for interactive use (why bother with them in scripts?), and you can't use two shells interactively at once
2015-11-09 06:28:03	SpaceToast	note: /etc/zsh/zprofile is a thing, and I'm not sure if it loads /etc/profile by default on gentoo, would need to check

2015-11-09 17:50:40	salviadud	oh, hehe
2015-11-09 17:51:26	shadowdaemon	Gentoo is my main OS, my "other" OS is actually Plan 9.
2015-11-09 17:52:29	salviadud	What is plan 9 before I feel obligated to google
2015-11-09 17:54:36	shadowdaemon	It's a research OS developed at Bell Labs.
2015-11-09 17:55:20	shadowdaemon	Googling probably wouldn't hurt.
2015-11-09 17:56:38	salviadud	So, plan 9 has its own kernel
2015-11-09 17:57:05	salviadud	Well, do you work at bell?
2015-11-09 17:57:28	salviadud	shadowdaemon, if you work at bell, that must be some paycheck.
2015-11-09 17:58:01	jerichowasahoax	isn't plan 9 that weird one that preserves state at all costs
2015-11-09 17:58:59	shadowdaemon	salviadud: Nope, I don't work there.
2015-11-09 18:00:22	salviadud	well, the rabbit is kinda cool
2015-11-09 18:00:30	salviadud	But is this plan 9 accesible
2015-11-09 18:00:34	salviadud	can I just download it
2015-11-09 18:00:37	salviadud	?
2015-11-09 18:01:49	salviadud	Their main page is full of broken links
2015-11-09 18:03:17	salviadud	I'm happy with my gentoo
2015-11-09 18:03:56	chry	:D
2015-11-09 18:05:19	shadowdaemon	Once you know how it works, it's pretty easy.
2015-11-09 18:05:42	shadowdaemon	Probably easier than a more modern OS.

2015-11-09 18:11:15	_anomaly_	you 'can't' install plan 9 on a single pc by the way, you need a minimum of 3 - one as a terminal, one as a cpu server, and one as auth/storage.   (you can actually compile the kernel to provide all those in a single image o run on a single pc but Rob Pike will lambast you and call you dirty names if you do)

2015-11-09 18:13:50	_anomaly_	but not ALL THE THINGS in pastel
2015-11-09 18:13:56	shadowdaemon	lol
2015-11-09 18:14:16	_anomaly_	low contrast leads to increased eye strain, as much as excessive contrast does
2015-11-09 18:14:38	_anomaly_	stare at acme long enough and you will temporarily go blind
2015-11-09 18:14:42	_anomaly_	actually happened to me once
2015-11-09 18:15:54	shadowdaemon	I love how the colors are hard-coded in.
2015-11-09 18:16:06	shadowdaemon	No messing about here.
2015-11-09 18:18:51	_anomaly_	and the border widths
2015-11-09 18:19:07	_anomaly_	i submitted a patch to make them 1px, got yelled at
2015-11-09 18:19:29	_anomaly_	so i submitted another to remove them entirely and pave the ground for an 'external' window decorator like fluxbox

2015-11-09 18:20:58	_anomaly_	then got bored and left because there's really nothing compelling about plan9
2015-11-09 18:21:07	shadowdaemon	My Plan 9 kernel is all-in-one.  *shrug*
2015-11-09 18:21:09	_anomaly_	well except 9p, which got ported to linux anyway
2015-11-09 18:21:44	shadowdaemon	I dunno, I find the pastels fairly compelling.
2015-11-09 18:21:50	_anomaly_	yer i noticed after a while that the things i brought up got adopted.. someone even did a fluxbox port for it..  i never got an apology or a 'yeah you were right' from them so f them

2015-11-09 18:22:54	shadowdaemon	Plan 9 is good for the hardware which I run it on.
2015-11-09 18:23:05	_anomaly_	a 486 dx2/66?
2015-11-09 18:23:09	shadowdaemon	Think old Athlon XP.
2015-11-09 18:23:12	_anomaly_	ah
2015-11-09 18:23:44	shadowdaemon	I used to have Gentoo on it, but I always wanted a "proper" Plan 9 system.
2015-11-09 18:25:03	shadowdaemon	Personally I like the ethos of the 9 Front crew.
2015-11-09 18:25:35	shadowdaemon	My system is a mash-up of traditional Plan 9 and 9Front.
2015-11-09 18:26:07	_anomaly_	i like the idea of plan9, but hate the implementation.  also it is *entirely* useless unless you have a bespoke distributed application you need to run on it
2015-11-09 18:26:14	shadowdaemon	Basically because I did a normal install, then decided I wanted bits from 9Front.
2015-11-09 18:27:50	shadowdaemon	_anomaly_: What don't you like, implementation wise?
2015-11-09 18:28:45	_anomaly_	it is entirely 100% completely insecure for starters
2015-11-09 18:29:11	_anomaly_	if my plan9 host can see yours I can access all your physical resources without any authentication or authorization
2015-11-09 18:29:18	_anomaly_	despite it having an 'auth' service
2015-11-09 18:29:27	_anomaly_	and by all I mean /all/
2015-11-09 18:29:34	_anomaly_	I can address individual pci cards in your host
2015-11-09 18:30:06	_anomaly_	also the fossil fs is a pita
2015-11-09 18:30:15	_anomaly_	and that other fs option is also a pita
2015-11-09 18:33:15	_anomaly_	bbl food time
2015-11-09 18:33:35	shadowdaemon	Enjoy.
2015-11-09 18:33:52	shadowdaemon	Dunno, auth is certainly needed here.
2015-11-09 18:34:04	shadowdaemon	Maybe you had it disabled or something.
2015-11-09 18:34:26	_anomaly_	it is easily bypassed
2015-11-09 18:34:56	_anomaly_	maybe they fixed that since ~2006
2015-11-09 18:35:07	_anomaly_	but i don't know how when they were more or less shut down

2015-11-09 19:47:57	anunnaki	i have a question
2015-11-09 19:48:30	anunnaki	how does one backup office 2010 if it came on their computer when they bought it.. all i have is a recovery disk.. which i think will just reinstall everything if i use it.
2015-11-09 19:50:03	+Griz64	anunnaki, a recover disk will do EXACTLY that.
2015-11-09 19:50:30	+Griz64	which is why i always pity those folks that buys systems, pre-bundled, like that.
2015-11-09 19:52:05	chry	You could use something live. ;p

2015-11-09 19:58:07	anunnaki	but now that im upgrading my windows 7 to 10.. i need that office 2010.. i think just putting the recovery dvd will just start installing everything including win 7..
2015-11-09 19:58:26	+Griz64	it will.

2015-11-09 20:00:02	anunnaki	its just office 2010.. nothing else came with office

2015-11-10 01:14:14	+wiktor_b	dugz: your -j and -l shouldn't exceed the number of threads your CPU can handle concurrently
2015-11-10 01:14:54	+wiktor_b	but you can use -l for all sorts of things, e.g. you can pass -l to be lower if you want some CPU time left over for other tasks or interactive use

2015-11-10 20:37:51	dugz	no, come think of it, it was emerge -C @steam that killed the beast, for sure
2015-11-10 20:38:58	pepperoni	anyone know of other choices to manage passwd's across a cluster other than openldap (which is severely broken)
2015-11-10 20:40:54	_anomaly_	you could always set up a dedicated microsoft activedirectory server and point pam_ldap at that
2015-11-10 20:41:14	pepperoni	or i could jump off a bridge
2015-11-10 20:41:17	_anomaly_	still broken just in different ways
2015-11-10 20:42:30	jesuisb	most config managements like puppet, chef, saltstack, etc can do it...bit of a big swatter for a small fly but i dont know of anything just user management besides roll-your-own

2015-11-10 20:42:45	jesuisb	nis
2015-11-10 20:42:54	jesuisb	make you hate other things just as much :)
2015-11-10 20:44:37	pepperoni	i sure hate ldap ATM, everything is so broken, docs, configs, you name it
2015-11-10 20:45:20	jesuisb	i've done openldap in the past without problems, but its a time investment to learn it all that's for sure
2015-11-10 20:45:39	jesuisb	lots of nice things it can do beyond what's out of the box though, sudo management, ssh key management...
2015-11-10 20:45:58	jesuisb	config management can do all that stuff for you too, though
2015-11-10 20:46:46	jesuisb	what's the newfangled everybody loves now, ansible i think that one's supposed to be easy to get going
2015-11-10 20:46:48	_anomaly_	here, we tend not to use passwords anyway
2015-11-10 20:46:50	_anomaly_	instead use keys
2015-11-10 20:47:24	pepperoni	even those have to be changed out somehow
2015-11-10 20:47:35	_anomaly_	yubikey where a password would be normally, ssh key otherwise
2015-11-10 20:47:45	_anomaly_	sure but thats easier to script
2015-11-10 20:47:49	_anomaly_	and centralize management
2015-11-10 20:47:51	_anomaly_	WITHOUT ldap
2015-11-10 20:48:10	_anomaly_	use ansible to deploy pubkeys to specific host classes
2015-11-10 20:48:11	_anomaly_	etc
2015-11-10 20:48:24	_anomaly_	(or to remove them when X leaves the company)

2015-11-10 20:49:44	pepperoni	yeah, i'm starting to get that feeling
2015-11-10 20:49:48	_anomaly_	https://github.com/ansible/ansible
2015-11-10 20:50:39	_anomaly_	Ansible Tower is some other product I'm not familiar with and has 'enterprise' slapped all over it
2015-11-10 20:50:47	_anomaly_	and isn't necessary for what i'm talking about
2015-11-10 20:51:34	_anomaly_	ansible opensource lets you write 'playbooks' which are kind of like ebuilds for doing things instead of building things
2015-11-10 20:52:12	pepperoni	i just hate the thought of another huge learning curve after spending so much time on ldap
2015-11-10 20:52:16	_anomaly_	and you define host groups for various classes such as [workstation] or [zimbraserver]  and then apply a playbook to a host group
2015-11-10 20:52:53	pepperoni	my needs are simple, manager user accounts on a cluster, adding a handful of users, changing passwds

2015-11-11 12:57:16	hosler	Griz64: are you sure its even a problem?
2015-11-11 12:57:26	redcheckers	griz, depends on the fs type
2015-11-11 12:57:45	+Griz64	hosler, oh, it runs well enough. i just hate seeing that line in read whenever i run an  fdisk -l
2015-11-11 12:57:57	hosler	Griz64: is it gtp by chance?

2015-11-11 12:58:29	hosler	Griz64: well if you reallly care. you can always zip up contents and then fix it. then extract
2015-11-11 12:58:34	+iamben	you can fix it with a resizer tool but there's a non-zero chance of data loss
2015-11-11 12:58:39	+iamben	ie gparted
2015-11-11 12:58:40	hosler	i dunno how to resize with beginning sector being different
2015-11-11 12:59:19	redcheckers	if its ext2 you can make a new partition and recover most of it. also TESTDISK sometimes works
2015-11-11 12:59:25	+Griz64	iamben, i was just in gparted but didn't see anything that looked like what i wanted.
2015-11-11 12:59:39	hosler	the zip/unzip method has added benefit of defragging
2015-11-11 12:59:53	+Griz64	redcheckers, did you LOOK at the paste??
2015-11-11 13:00:33	+iamben	Griz64: resize/move wont work?
2015-11-11 13:00:58	+Griz64	iamben, dunno. didn't do more than create SWAP at the end of it. guess i could give it a whirl.
2015-11-11 13:01:00	hosler	iamben: doesnt beginning point need to remain consistent for resize?
2015-11-11 13:01:20	+Griz64	hosler, your idea has merit, but that's a LOT of data to zip/move/restore
2015-11-11 13:01:31	hosler	life is hard
2015-11-11 13:01:35	redcheckers	griz I did.

2015-11-11 13:02:04	hosler	omg
2015-11-11 13:02:06	+iamben	hosler: i think gparted can handle it
2015-11-11 13:02:16	hosler	i only did a resize once and i was SCARED
2015-11-11 13:02:20	hosler	but it worked
2015-11-11 13:02:38	+Griz64	redcheckers, okay. well, it's HPFS/NTFS/exFAT & Linux SWAP on the drive. :-P  no extX
2015-11-11 13:02:57	+NeddySeagoon	Griz64: there is no issue with that part table
2015-11-11 13:02:59	+iamben	Griz64: technically the partition type doesnt for sure tell you what FS is used
2015-11-11 13:02:59	hosler	ohh yeah
2015-11-11 13:03:49	+Griz64	NeddySeagoon, then why the "Partition 1 does not start on physical sector boundary." in red?
2015-11-11 13:04:38	+Griz64	hosler, i use gparted all the time. simply love it! never once have i lost data.
2015-11-11 13:04:50	+Griz64	well, not on a 'Good' (tm) drive.
2015-11-11 13:04:57	+NeddySeagoon	Griz64: It an old convention from DOS.  Even DOS didn't care
2015-11-11 13:05:23	+Griz64	NeddySeagoon, so, i'm golden? i can just train myself to ignore that warning??

2015-11-11 14:28:00	anunnaki	i googled these issues and theres plenty of people complaining. go into ##windows and theyre like.. oh dont worry about it.. just burn the iso to media and boot.. its like i shouldnt have to go out and buy a dvd or usb key to install something everyone else is able to install thru their notification/updates
2015-11-11 14:29:01	anunnaki	then they tell me to wait a couple day sfor the new build to be released where i can just download it.. and use my windows 8 key to register it.. yeah somehow i doubt its going to go smoothly
2015-11-11 14:30:46	anunnaki	the windows devs didnt like me saying in the channel how their updates end up breaking my system..

2015-11-11 15:31:10	mvaenskae	but if i enable TearFree it kills my terminals
2015-11-11 15:32:23	mvaenskae	if i watch a fullscreen video my intel buffer is totally confused and just redraws half the terminal lines or such upon cursor blink
2015-11-11 15:37:59	SpaceToast	mvaenskae: what kind of tearing / in what situations?
2015-11-11 15:38:49	mvaenskae	SpaceToast: vertical tearing, about the middle of the screen in rows
2015-11-11 15:40:16	mvaenskae	and if i enable TearFree for my intel gpu and i have a video in full screen on one screen and a full screen terminal on the other the terminal is totally broken
2015-11-11 15:40:36	mvaenskae	visually that is, not functionally
2015-11-11 15:40:37	SpaceToast	with TearFree the video is good though, right?
2015-11-11 15:40:42	mvaenskae	yes
2015-11-11 15:41:02	mvaenskae	i manage my monitors with xrandr
2015-11-11 15:41:07	mvaenskae	and run i3
2015-11-11 15:41:09	SpaceToast	so, what is probably the problem, is SNA acceleration is causing this
2015-11-11 15:41:15	SpaceToast	(TearFree applies to SNA, so...)
2015-11-11 15:41:23	SpaceToast	you could try changing to a different acceleration method
2015-11-11 15:41:29	mvaenskae	SNA is the newest accel, right?
2015-11-11 15:41:36	SpaceToast	yeah

2015-11-11 15:44:30	SpaceToast	also, you can enable DRI3 (DRI2 is default)
2015-11-11 15:44:52	SpaceToast	also, if you're using TearFree, and SwapbuffersWait is false it might break stuff
2015-11-11 15:45:17	mvaenskae	SwapBuffersWait should be true?
2015-11-11 15:45:28	mvaenskae	also, how to enable dri3 explictly? :)
2015-11-11 15:45:52	SpaceToast	dri3 : Option      "DRI"    "3"
2015-11-11 15:46:03	SpaceToast	UXA: Option      "AccelMethod"  "uxa"

2015-11-11 16:05:37	Viperlin	no i think they invoke it seperately
2015-11-11 16:05:48	Viperlin	it's mostly for UI special effects, transparency etc

2015-11-11 16:06:37	mvaenskae	anyways, i am wondering why this issue arises
2015-11-11 16:06:49	Viperlin	are the terminals transparent?

2015-11-11 16:08:07	Viperlin	it is absurd that they distort then
2015-11-11 16:08:41	mvaenskae	interestingly the issue arises the moment activity is in the terminal
2015-11-11 16:08:45	mvaenskae	like me typing or such
2015-11-11 16:08:55	mvaenskae	or the cursor blinking
2015-11-11 16:10:07	mvaenskae	the video, if not full-screen works fine btw

2015-11-11 16:41:10	anunnaki	shiznix: i was told once you upgrade to win10 you cant downgrade to any of the previous windows.. so one would have to reinstall with the cd. i was trying to create a restore point of win 8.1 in case i wasnt happy with win10..
2015-11-11 16:41:28	anunnaki	not sure if that was possible to do but i wanted to try. i was guessing the settings would get carried over including restore pointes

2015-11-11 16:44:22	shiznix	anunnaki: you are supposed to be able to downgrade back to previous versions of windows, though this option is only available for 1 month after upgrading to win10

2015-11-11 16:53:39	jesuisb	it's ok, they are.
2015-11-11 16:53:45	dugz	MAKEOPTS -> to make not to emerge
2015-11-11 16:54:20	anunnaki	-j is just the shorter version of it.. like -a is --ask
2015-11-11 16:56:59	mvaenskae	if --jobs emerges multiple packages simultaneously it cannot be -j as -j allows spawning concurrent merge job for a single package but not multiple ones
2015-11-11 16:57:15	dugz	you never made a kernel with "make -j5" ?  thats what MAKEOPTS="-j5" does
2015-11-11 16:57:57	mvaenskae	from my experience MAKEOPTS is not read from make
2015-11-11 16:58:18	dugz	it pegs all my cores when it is set right
2015-11-11 16:59:38	dugz	mvaenskae, I think I am in agreement with you, -j5 != -j 5
2015-11-11 16:59:41	mvaenskae	i have to explicitly set -j inside every make i call
2015-11-11 17:00:37	dugz	EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS Options to append to the end of the emerge(1) command
2015-11-11 17:00:54	mvaenskae	i have MAKEOPTS="-j12 -l15" so kernel making should really create some load, right?
2015-11-11 17:01:04	dugz	MAKEOPTS Use  this variable if you want to use parallel make.
2015-11-11 17:01:05	mvaenskae	if i just call "make kernel"

2015-11-11 17:03:03	dugz	i do compile my kernel using -j5 for my quad

2015-11-11 17:04:36	dugz	I need a better understanding of --load-average though and how it is figured; e.g. is it just like from the top command?

2015-11-11 17:06:21	mvaenskae	dugz: i would guess it will spawn jobs until a load of X is achieved
2015-11-11 17:06:40	dugz	mvaenskae, right, it must be the same as what top shows
2015-11-11 17:07:07	jesuisb	you misunderstand me. they are exactly the same, so why be inconsistent -j in one case --jobs --load-average in another? but whatever. -l15 whould not say lib15. it is a make option. and load average is load average. yes, top displays it.
2015-11-11 17:07:08	mvaenskae	i read somewhere an explanation
2015-11-11 17:07:33	jesuisb	average of runnable jobs
2015-11-11 17:07:41	dugz	jesuisb, MAKEOPTS gets passed to make, EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS is appended to the emerge line
2015-11-11 17:07:48	mvaenskae	i think it was in conjunction with distcc
2015-11-11 17:08:14	dugz	both make and emerge have a -j option which are similar
2015-11-11 17:08:28	jesuisb	yes. i know.
2015-11-11 17:09:39	dugz	so my question is, how to best set these three things with an N-core processor
2015-11-11 17:10:46	mvaenskae	benchmarks ;)
2015-11-11 17:10:56	jesuisb	there is no determinate answer to that. most people say cores-1 or so. pick a value around there, try it, try others if you really care, see what's best
2015-11-11 17:11:04	mvaenskae	sorry for the lame answer but that is likely the most valid one
2015-11-11 17:11:06	jesuisb	then compile some other package with other behavior
2015-11-11 17:12:19	dugz	I'm tending to thing that the MAKEOPTS vs the EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS are kind of mutually exclusive. Use one set or the other
2015-11-11 17:13:07	dugz	otherwise, --jobs will be spawning multithreaded jobs via make -jN
2015-11-11 17:14:15	 *	jesuisb walks away
2015-11-11 17:14:20	dugz	hehe
2015-11-11 17:16:36	dugz	alright, i have a quad, 4 hw threads. MAKEOPTS="-j2" EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-j 2 --load-average 3.6" might in theory do it. 2 jobs with 2 threads each
2015-11-11 17:18:05	dugz	gonna try it!
2015-11-11 17:20:07	mvaenskae	is there a command that returns me which packages rely on what python version?
2015-11-11 17:20:22	mvaenskae	the packages that are installed that is
2015-11-11 17:20:39	mvaenskae	wondering if python3.5 can be used systemwide as "default" already :)
2015-11-11 17:20:53	dugz	not sure here
2015-11-11 17:22:08	dugz	I think --jobs and --load-average maybe are only good for a list of emerges not a single package
2015-11-11 17:29:06	dugz	ok --load-average is the same numbers used by "top"

2015-11-11 17:34:09	dugz	the load average is the number of threads waiting for a CPU
2015-11-11 17:39:58	dugz	so load-average = cores * 0.9 is a pretty good estimate after all for a system running at 90% capacity!

2015-11-11 22:28:36	chry	Yea, I didn't know what to search for, lol..
2015-11-11 22:28:44	chry	That was the biggest issue here, actually..
2015-11-11 22:29:25	_anomaly_	it was a bit obscure
2015-11-11 22:29:39	+lejonet	Mhm, because searching like "java program is blank" doesn't turn up anything useful and such
2015-11-11 22:29:44	+lejonet	:P
2015-11-11 22:29:49	+lejonet	it is indeed obscure
2015-11-11 22:30:09	chry	Yeah, I figured if I typed something like that google would lol at me...

2015-11-11 22:31:16	_anomaly_	i googled for 'android studio dwm' btw
2015-11-11 22:31:29	+lejonet	But 2 of them actually were related to it, "Swing - Java program showing blank screen" on Stack Overflow and swing - Frame comes up blank
2015-11-11 22:31:31	_anomaly_	and got lucky that the first 2 results were bug reports with workarounds

2015-11-12 17:01:42	SpaceToast	XFS is very good for large files, so if you're planning to use it as a "all of my movies" drive, that works. Otherwise, just default to ext4, really.

2015-11-13 21:03:29	Cheaterman	right
2015-11-13 21:03:33	chry	Yee..
2015-11-13 21:03:34	Cheaterman	bad tutorial, according to most
2015-11-13 21:03:36	Cheaterman	including me
2015-11-13 21:03:39	Cheaterman	too long, boring
2015-11-13 21:03:48	Cheaterman	but if you have absolutely no programming background then it's better than most
2015-11-13 21:03:51	Cheaterman	i suppose
2015-11-13 21:04:00	chry	I though that was exactly the point of prog tuts...
2015-11-13 21:04:02	chry	:D
2015-11-13 21:04:07	Cheaterman	err
2015-11-13 21:04:12	Cheaterman	http://learnpython.org
2015-11-13 21:04:16	Cheaterman	learn python the INTERACTIVE way
2015-11-13 21:04:21	chry	I have a lots of background...I just haven't worked on any real projects... ;p
2015-11-13 21:04:23	Cheaterman	ie the way it was ALWAYS meant to be taught
2015-11-13 21:04:38	Cheaterman	very concise tutorial that'll get throught most python mechanics
2015-11-13 21:04:42	Cheaterman	except meta classes
2015-11-13 21:05:11	Cheaterman	also look at my script to know how to use python as bash-like scripting language
2015-11-13 21:05:13	chry	Well, from the table of contents I see it's basically the same...except for this advanced part...
2015-11-13 21:06:09	Cheaterman	and it's MUCH shorter

2015-11-15 10:40:03	+Griz64	arvut, i strongly advise looking into dispatch-conf the next time you have those files to handle.
2015-11-15 10:40:08	torindel	arvut: funny thing that i managed only 3 ram dimms in that thing, both cpu and gpu (nvidia) was fine on high temps
2015-11-15 10:40:26	arvut	Griz64: I just changed the way it syncs to git, it used old rsync settings
2015-11-15 10:40:37	arvut	that sync though, took some time
2015-11-15 10:41:23	torindel	managed to fry*
2015-11-15 10:42:23	arvut	I fried my ram on my core2 some time ago
2015-11-15 10:42:45	+xiaomiao	fried ram with some sweet potato?
2015-11-15 10:42:47	arvut	it ran kde4 with minor issues
2015-11-15 10:43:16	eroen	arvut: ansible it!
2015-11-15 10:43:22	arvut	xiaomiao: no, I only fry clue with potato, the non sweet kind
2015-11-15 10:43:36	eroen	at least Tatsh keeps telling me that that's the solution :)
2015-11-15 10:44:00	arvut	eroen: I assimilated the harddrive, it serves as slow windoze hdd for 8.1 (which is getting nuked tonight cuz im tired of it)
2015-11-15 10:44:17	arvut	5400rpm is just the right speed for win 8.1
2015-11-15 10:44:21	arvut	xD
2015-11-15 10:46:10	+Smiley	yum cue sticks
2015-11-15 10:46:43	arvut	Smiley: U WANNA BUY SOME DEATHSTICKS?
2015-11-15 10:47:21	+Smiley	dethstix?4
2015-11-15 10:47:25	Poison[BLX]	... deathsticks sound far more fun than they likely should, considering the name.
2015-11-15 10:48:17	arvut	well, I think 20/20 is fun enough in good stereo
2015-11-15 10:48:29	arvut	Poison[BLX]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev7tIVwMHq4
2015-11-15 10:48:47	arvut	with or without intoxication
2015-11-15 10:49:03	arvut	the sound itself is rather intoxicatiing on its own
2015-11-15 10:49:20	arvut	hey, why is my i key behaving like this?
2015-11-15 10:49:23	arvut	glitchy hw?
2015-11-15 10:49:27	arvut	or software bug?
2015-11-15 10:50:48	Poison[BLX]	it appears to be working well on this end.
2015-11-15 10:51:00	Poison[BLX]	whassit doing?
2015-11-15 10:52:34	eroen	Smiley: caustics?
2015-11-15 10:53:17	Poison[BLX]	also, while that sounds alright-ish, I suspect it'd be much, much, better not playing on these laptop speakers.
2015-11-15 10:55:36	Poison[BLX]	also, a full 1% of a person's weight in beef brisket is likely more than they should eat in one sitting, from a health perspective, isn't it?
2015-11-15 10:56:09	arvut	this is high quality sound, should be played in suitable soundsystem
2015-11-15 10:57:03	arvut	around 5 minutes when the track is all built up, all just clicks so well together..
2015-11-15 10:58:02	arvut	but getting there without skipping gotta be done with decent hardware, else not at all
2015-11-15 10:58:31	Poison[BLX]	the laptop was handy to get a general sense, youtube doesn't like to cooperate with my desktop's audio system... and pulling something down to a more cooperative form there's wasted effort if the general sound doesn't work for me :P
2015-11-15 10:59:33	arvut	and then when the last minute is on, 9th or so, you begin to realize that this truetrue sound is gonna fade away soon, no good news xD
2015-11-15 10:59:55	arvut	Poison[BLX]: 3.5mm to RCA and into amp?
2015-11-15 10:59:58	<════	doc235 (~Blain@gentoo/contributor/doc235) has quit (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2015-11-15 11:00:22	arvut	although, coax spdif would be better
2015-11-15 11:00:51	Poison[BLX]	5.1 on 3.5s to rca into an amp, yeah.
2015-11-15 11:01:30	arvut	hmm, might need digital there
2015-11-15 11:01:33	Poison[BLX]	and spdif would be wonderful... if things supported setting anything better than stereo out gaming-wise on a digital output.
2015-11-15 11:01:39	+Smiley	so it turns out that wiktor_b agrees with donald trump
2015-11-15 11:01:54	arvut	but I don't know many laptops that comes with a spdif soundcard, would need external for that
2015-11-15 11:02:12	arvut	but 44.1khz stereo is good enough for this music
2015-11-15 11:02:13	Poison[BLX]	meh, I just throw things at the desktop for real audio.
2015-11-15 11:02:17	arvut	if u can just get it to amp
2015-11-15 11:02:27	arvut	throw 20/20
2015-11-15 11:02:34	Poison[BLX]	planned to :)
2015-11-15 11:02:48	Poison[BLX]	laptop didn't do it justice, but did good enough to tell me I wants it.

2015-11-15 11:04:44	arvut	dat luvly tum
2015-11-15 11:06:44	Cheaterman	it's very minimal
2015-11-15 11:06:47	Cheaterman	very very
2015-11-15 11:06:59	Poison[BLX]	and.. while stereo would suffice for this, I hate to imagine it on that receiver w/o the sub in use.
2015-11-15 11:07:14	Poison[BLX]	granted, my neighbors will likely hate the exact opposite, played at much volume.
2015-11-15 11:07:26	Cheaterman	can't make everyone happi right
2015-11-15 11:07:55	Cheaterman	and it's not like we don't try hard really
2015-11-15 11:09:03	Poison[BLX]	gah! why's the raspberry tea flavored can the same color as the pomegranite tea flavored ones?!
2015-11-15 11:09:42	arvut	Cheaterman: its very progressive actually, wait until like 5 min mark and it has completed all loops
2015-11-15 11:09:48	arvut	then break is about 5:50 I think
2015-11-15 11:09:54	Cheaterman	owiii
2015-11-15 11:09:56	arvut	and then goes back into tumtum
2015-11-15 11:10:08	arvut	but yeah, kinda minimal
2015-11-15 11:10:12	Cheaterman	how do you write clean, testable code?
2015-11-15 11:10:16	arvut	although I've never heard of minimal trance
2015-11-15 11:10:27	arvut	Cheaterman: with javascript
2015-11-15 11:10:44	Cheaterman	arvut: so your answer is, "I don't"
2015-11-15 11:10:49	arvut	lol

2015-11-15 11:11:08	Cheaterman	owiii doc235 ^__^
2015-11-15 11:11:27	arvut	eeeeey what's up doc!
2015-11-15 11:11:41	Poison[BLX]	define 'clean' and 'testable'.
2015-11-15 11:11:54	arvut	we were just discussing clean code and minimalistic music
2015-11-15 11:12:47	arvut	testable as in PoC or "just runs, no feedback"?
2015-11-15 11:12:54	Cheaterman	more like TDD
2015-11-15 11:12:56	Poison[BLX]	yeah, I was answering. You have to have a clear definition of those before you write code, or you'll forever miss the mark by some interpretation of the definition you weren't actually targtting when it was written :P
2015-11-15 11:13:21	arvut	try a google javascript, lovely clean code
2015-11-15 11:13:22	Cheaterman	Poison[BLX]: that's an excellent point actually
2015-11-15 11:13:23	arvut	...
2015-11-15 11:13:31	Laurenzo	hmm hi
2015-11-15 11:13:56	Cheaterman	I'd say my general objectives would be clean as in "proper separation of concerns" and testable as in "100% unit test coverage, for features that are testable"
2015-11-15 11:14:08	Cheaterman	does that sound good/achievable/sensible,
2015-11-15 11:14:10	Cheaterman	?
2015-11-15 11:14:13	Poison[BLX]	I... didn't win any points with that accurate-but-sarcasm-laden-type answer in classes ;)
2015-11-15 11:14:24	arvut	compare to some kernel code written in C, huge difference in structure and cleaness
2015-11-15 11:14:36	Laurenzo	What's going on here...
2015-11-15 11:14:37	Cheaterman	Poison[BLX]: although in real corporate envs it's most likely the right answer
2015-11-15 11:14:49	Poison[BLX]	exactly :)
2015-11-15 11:14:51	arvut	Laurenzo: nothing and everything
2015-11-15 11:14:52	Laurenzo	Holy Testing War?
2015-11-15 11:14:53	Cheaterman	arvut: kernel code is no example of cleanliness
2015-11-15 11:15:01	arvut	Cheaterman: I think its neat
2015-11-15 11:15:29	arvut	but thats my definition of clean
2015-11-15 11:15:42	Cheaterman	my definition of clean implies something manageable
2015-11-15 11:15:45	Cheaterman	:)
2015-11-15 11:15:46	Laurenzo	If I could a) Test everything I wanted and b) Model everything I wanted in terms of relational databases, I'd be the happiest developer ever.
2015-11-15 11:15:56	arvut	and googles way to write compact javascript is the opposite
2015-11-15 11:15:57	Poison[BLX]	Cheaterman: and yeah, your testable definition might benefit from more clarity on 'that are testable', such as 'exposed features' in a module, or such,
2015-11-15 11:16:06	Cheaterman	Laurenzo: already got to do b). now trying to work on a)
2015-11-15 11:16:23	arvut	well, they are still managing the linux kernel pretty well it seems :)
2015-11-15 11:16:31	Cheaterman	Poison[BLX]: well for instance UI is hard to test.
2015-11-15 11:16:39	Laurenzo	Cheaterman: lucky you. I am modeling quite annoying system w databases...
2015-11-15 11:16:40	Cheaterman	we provide a screenshot-based framework but it's hackish
2015-11-15 11:16:41	Laurenzo	;p
2015-11-15 11:16:42	Cheaterman	as it sounds
2015-11-15 11:16:52	Laurenzo	I hate the requirements
2015-11-15 11:17:18	Laurenzo	but then again, I could just try to push as much of the responsibility of the hard bits in the db to application code
2015-11-15 11:17:20	Poison[BLX]	hmm. Where's your UI sit, OS-wise?
2015-11-15 11:17:21	Laurenzo	>;p
2015-11-15 11:17:33	Poison[BLX]	if it's on windows, autohotkey's your best friend.
2015-11-15 11:18:07	Cheaterman	Poison[BLX]: weither authotkey can or cannot do what I want (and from the name i'd say it cannot) is not relevant hehe
2015-11-15 11:18:41	Cheaterman	simulating inputs is easy to do in my framework
2015-11-15 11:18:53	Cheaterman	less so analyzing the visual results and checking they're consistent
2015-11-15 11:19:03	nebg	anybody here uses tmux ?
2015-11-15 11:19:07	Cheaterman	as i said we have some screenshot based thingy but it's hackish
2015-11-15 11:19:17	Poison[BLX]	ah, that'd be the side it won't do as well :)
2015-11-15 11:19:39	Cheaterman	so yeah, that'd be the parts of "untestable" code Poison[BLX]
2015-11-15 11:19:47	Cheaterman	but anything pure algorithmics should be testable one way or another
2015-11-15 11:20:00	Poison[BLX]	yup.
2015-11-15 11:20:26	Poison[BLX]	and a q&a human-at-keyboard testing pass should catch the visual side, one would hope.
2015-11-15 11:20:34	arvut	nebg: everyone does it
2015-11-15 11:20:39	Cheaterman	Poison[BLX]: artists :)
2015-11-15 11:20:48	Cheaterman	q&a artists visual pass
2015-11-15 11:20:52	Cheaterman	"oh you integrated our assets wrong"
2015-11-15 11:21:00	Cheaterman	"no, your assets were wrong, that's different"
2015-11-15 11:21:04	Poison[BLX]	heh, yup, that.
2015-11-15 11:21:05	Poison[BLX]	:)
2015-11-15 11:21:06	nebg	arvut, ok... do you know how  can i exchange a pane with an existing windo ?
2015-11-15 11:21:07	Cheaterman	:)
2015-11-15 11:21:09	nebg	*window
2015-11-15 11:21:22	Poison[BLX]	and this. this is why I do sysadmin work, not dev work.
2015-11-15 11:21:33	Cheaterman	i like our artists :)
2015-11-15 11:21:46	nebg	arvut... let's say i'm in window 2, and i split it... well another terminal opens up.. but  iwant to put window 3 as a pane instead of the new blank terminal
2015-11-15 11:22:48	Poison[BLX]	well... 20/20 is a lot more interesting even just at the start than it was on laptop speakers :P
2015-11-15 11:23:19	Cheaterman	should use my bt speaker
2015-11-15 11:23:31	Cheaterman	also it's weird i'm on ubuntu but i'm not sure i'm using PA
2015-11-15 11:23:52	+zlg	Ubuntu should ship with PA unless you went Ubuntu server.
2015-11-15 11:24:05	+zlg	LXDE version might not use it.
2015-11-15 11:24:11	Cheaterman	zlg: oh that's why
2015-11-15 11:24:11	Poison[BLX]	part of me wants to ask how, and part of me wants to just back away slowly and ask no questions. Guess which is inning? :P
2015-11-15 11:24:13	Cheaterman	they really rock
2015-11-15 11:24:19	Cheaterman	i'm on lubuntu

2015-11-15 11:24:36	Cheaterman	Poison[BLX]: my hdd fried, should be well known
2015-11-15 11:24:41	Laurenzo	hmmm...
2015-11-15 11:24:43	Cheaterman	so i'm on lubuntu liveusb since 3 days
2015-11-15 11:24:58	+Griz64	doc235, what happened?
2015-11-15 11:25:35	Cheaterman	doc235: let's help you blibilbli
2015-11-15 11:25:37	doc235	cpu toasting so i shut down and clean out burnt dust fronm the heatsink. turn it back on and no video
2015-11-15 11:25:40	Poison[BLX]	I meant how you managed ubuntu w/o pa, though lubuntu's a good cause of that one. I've actually moved to using pa on my gentoo->lxde/ratpoison monstrosities of laptops, though, and it plays pretty well.
2015-11-15 11:26:08	Cheaterman	i don't use PA on my usual OS
2015-11-15 11:26:31	+Griz64	doc235, check the cabling, first thing.
2015-11-15 11:26:32	Poison[BLX]	it's handy for a few narrow things, as long as your hardware very closely matches what pa assumes you ought to be using.
2015-11-15 11:26:51	arvut	ok, how do I upgrade a old kde4 to 4.8.6 from .5?
2015-11-15 11:26:53	Poison[BLX]	and as long as your use-case for that hardware's close to what pa decided it ought to be.
2015-11-15 11:26:58	arvut	blocks and stuffs
2015-11-15 11:27:15	doc235	checked all cables and connectors. just no vidoe, the mobo light comes on and the3 lkeds on the nic work but no video signal to the monitor
2015-11-15 11:27:26	Cheaterman	Poison[BLX]: ie if you're using hd audio or ac97 like 99% of the people you should be fine
2015-11-15 11:27:28	doc235	i am going to have to configure this laptop
2015-11-15 11:27:43	Cheaterman	plus the occasional bt speaker which PA handles better than alsa since it supports bluez5
2015-11-15 11:27:53	Cheaterman	or rather bluez5 supports only PA
2015-11-15 11:28:07	doc235	ok  how to qactivate my externel monitor :)
2015-11-15 11:28:14	Poison[BLX]	Cheaterman: yup, though it also handles digital outs like hdmi and such fairly seamlessly... usually.
2015-11-15 11:28:21	nebg	arvut, are you there ?
2015-11-15 11:28:33	Cheaterman	doc235: most simply, try ctrl + alt + F1 to go to a terminal
2015-11-15 11:28:35	+Griz64	doc235, try the Kontrol Panel/Monitor
2015-11-15 11:28:52	Cheaterman	Poison[BLX]: another good point yes, it can be a PITA to get sound on TV with alsa
2015-11-15 11:29:00	+Smiley	yo ho ho
2015-11-15 11:29:05	Cheaterman	Smiley: owi owi owi

2015-11-15 11:29:13	Poison[BLX]	Cheaterman: it can be even worse with pa, depending on the video card ;)

2015-11-15 11:33:49	Cheaterman	doc235: I gave you command
2015-11-15 11:34:01	doc235	i can't get to a konsole
2015-11-15 11:34:03	Cheaterman	doc235: is command giant screen OK? now command for 2 screens
2015-11-15 11:34:06	doc235	let me try something
2015-11-15 11:34:07	Cheaterman	doc235: ctrl+Alt+F1
2015-11-15 11:34:10	doc235	hang on
2015-11-15 11:34:11	Cheaterman	go to TTY
2015-11-15 11:34:35	Cheaterman	command for 2 screens is:
2015-11-15 11:34:42	Cheaterman	first, export DISPLAY=:0
2015-11-15 11:34:45	Cheaterman	so you don't have to do it again
2015-11-15 11:34:48	Cheaterman	then xrandr
2015-11-15 11:34:53	doc235	okk what is the command again?
2015-11-15 11:34:58	Cheaterman	which will show all your screens, and in particular the ones that are connected
2015-11-15 11:35:20	Cheaterman	finally, you'll use xrandr --output ONE_OF_YOUR_SCREENS --right-of OTHER_ONE --auto
2015-11-15 11:35:30	Cheaterman	doc235: but for now
2015-11-15 11:35:37	Cheaterman	doc235: DISPLAY=:0 xrandr --auto
2015-11-15 11:35:47	Cheaterman	should make screen repeat on both monitors
2015-11-15 11:35:54	doc235	what command though, i losyt it in all the responses i missed cause of this screen :)
2015-11-15 11:36:11	Cheaterman	doc235: DISPLAY=:0 xrandr --auto
2015-11-15 11:36:13	Cheaterman	should make screen repeat on both monitors

2015-11-15 11:37:14	doc235	did not work. no protocol specified
2015-11-15 11:37:18	Cheaterman	also it should set each screen to its natural reos
2015-11-15 11:37:46	Cheaterman	doc235: means your x server is maybe down? or you need xhost +
2015-11-15 11:38:01	Poison[BLX]	or.. it might not be :0
2015-11-15 11:38:19	Cheaterman	yeah that too
2015-11-15 11:39:07	Poison[BLX]	ls -l /tmp/.X* ... and see what numbers are active, is my lazy lookup. Not sure if there's a "proper" way.
2015-11-15 11:39:15	doc235	ok  i can't select anything from my kde menu since it is gone
2015-11-15 11:39:32	doc235	how to get a konsole window running
2015-11-15 11:39:55	doc235	i can't goto settings or anything to change this
2015-11-15 11:40:17	doc235	Cheaterman, the xserver is running since i am running kde4
2015-11-15 11:41:33	Poison[BLX]	doc235: at a real tty, ls -l /tmp/.X* ... so you can see what number your active X session is, so you can set DISPLAY=:<number> to run things pointed at it. Also, are you in the same user in your KDE session as your TTY?
2015-11-15 11:41:47	+Griz64	doc235, does ALT+F2 give you the 'run' dialog?
2015-11-15 11:42:18	doc235	got it Griz64  thanks
2015-11-15 11:42:20	doc235	now

2015-11-15 11:42:50	Poison[BLX]	nifty, I always forget about that one... the downside to not running a proper DE around here :P
2015-11-15 11:43:11	doc235	ok  what am i looking for with that command?
2015-11-15 11:43:45	Poison[BLX]	well, since you have a terminal in your X session now, you're looking for your primary and secondary display names in xrandr
2015-11-15 11:45:02	doc235	therre is no xrandr in the output from ls -l /tmp/.x*
2015-11-15 11:45:35	doc235	 /tmp/x11-unix: total 0
2015-11-15 11:46:06	Poison[BLX]	nono, the /tmp/.X* was to find what number your X session overall is, so you could point xrandr at it, but since you can run things *in* it now, you're past that point :)
2015-11-15 11:46:22	doc235	:)
2015-11-15 11:46:24	doc235	ok
2015-11-15 11:46:25	Poison[BLX]	so, just 'xrandr' will list your displays, their resolutions, etc :)
2015-11-15 11:46:39	doc235	if my menu bar went across both screens it would be nice
2015-11-15 11:47:02	Poison[BLX]	xrandr --auto that Cheaterman recommended *should* get you to cloned displays.
2015-11-15 11:47:59	doc235	nope
2015-11-15 11:48:03	Poison[BLX]	if it doesn't, you can set the working display as primary & disable the non-working one, all via xrandr... but the names vary from system to system.
2015-11-15 11:48:28	doc235	is xrandr got a gui?
2015-11-15 11:48:37	doc235	it did not change
2015-11-15 11:48:40	Poison[BLX]	I think KDE provides one.

2015-11-15 11:58:08	Poison[BLX]	and yup, I recall that being a simple build gcc -> switch to the new one (manually, depending on what versions you have), re-source the profile, and build glibc.

2015-11-15 11:58:38	Poison[BLX]	doc235: it *should* auto-reenable the laptop display.

2015-11-15 11:59:16	doc235	it did not
2015-11-15 11:59:54	arvut	yeah, it just decided to put glibc before gcc in the prioritychain of jobs to do
2015-11-15 12:00:50	Poison[BLX]	arvut: if it decides the new gcc's different enough to slot in alongside the existing, you'll need to gcc-config switch to the new one before glibc will play well ;)

2015-11-15 16:14:04	Poison[BLX]	newegg tends to have the 'dock' style for $20-40US, depending on usb3, builtin usb hub, card readers, etc.
2015-11-15 16:15:38	+doc235	this is an old toshiba satellite dual core. so it is much slower than my quad core that just died :)
2015-11-15 16:15:49	+doc235	so all i need is a cable? it looks like it
2015-11-15 16:16:02	+doc235	no usb3 support on it
2015-11-15 16:16:37	+doc235	hmmmmm everything is usb3.0 :/
2015-11-15 16:16:51	+doc235	will that still work on 1.2 and 2?
2015-11-15 16:16:53	Poison[BLX]	nono, the docks are sata->usb, sit on the desk, allow hot-swapping drives and other nifty things. If you have a spare sata port in the system, though, you can use a laptop drive on standard sata
2015-11-15 16:17:01	Poison[BLX]	and... yeah, they should
2015-11-15 16:17:42	+doc235	well it will have to wait. i don't have the money right now
2015-11-15 16:18:01	+doc235	so i will play games figuring out all the configurations i lost
2015-11-15 16:18:25	Poison[BLX]	well, as I mentioned, if you have a spare internal sata port & a cable, laptop sata's the same as any other, just a physically smaller drive.
2015-11-15 16:19:24	Poison[BLX]	doh, ignore me, read that backwards.
2015-11-15 16:19:51	Poison[BLX]	just remembered you'd be going the other way. This is why I shouldn't IRC while doing other things. :P
2015-11-15 16:21:07	+doc235	i can't figure out what i am looking for. sheesh.

2015-11-15 16:21:50	+doc235	that is the cable i was talking about Poison[BLX]
2015-11-15 16:23:52	+doc235	nope, that is 2.5 inch. i need the 3.5
2015-11-15 16:26:32	Poison[BLX]	yeah, that would only give 5V power, you need one that gives 12v to run a full size drive
2015-11-15 16:28:14	Poison[BLX]	http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S1O43CS should do the trick
2015-11-15 16:29:08	Poison[BLX]	and is cheaper than what I usually pay for the bytecc, thermaltake, startech, or vantec branded ones via newegg.

2015-11-16 18:20:51	robink	infinmed: I mean interesting, and I'm not in any way bothered that you highlighted me about your recent acquisition, but what led you to believe that I would be more interested in it than others here?
2015-11-16 18:21:00	infinmed	Solaris is another thing as it is enterprise unix from teh second largest software company (and perhaps soon to be hardware) in the world
2015-11-16 18:21:07	infinmed	That happens to run as a unix derivative
2015-11-16 18:21:08	robink	infinmed: Oh, because you answered me about the Radeon cards
2015-11-16 18:21:14	+hosler	robink: just be polite
2015-11-16 18:21:14	infinmed	Although at this point it's all rewritten, there is no bsd in solaris
2015-11-16 18:21:24	+iamben	kinda along the same lines as the mainstream linux disros, "great until you want to do something unusual"
2015-11-16 18:21:44	+iamben	WRT solaris, fbsd, etc
2015-11-16 18:21:45	robink	infinmed: The reason I'm tempted to buy an R9 285 or R9 380 is because both have Tonga chipsets which are currently the best-performing under the Linux AMDGPU driver (they beat out Fiji (the current flagship chipset) by a wide margin).
2015-11-16 18:22:00	robink	hosler: I wasn't meaning to be impolite, but lacking context I thought it was a random comment directed my way.
2015-11-16 18:22:14	+hosler	robink: cornbread pasta sauce
2015-11-16 18:22:48	infinmed	robink: well what you make me ask is this.. assumingly it's an expensive card like 150+ ? Yeh ? Well, are you planning on gaming hardcore in linux? And or else....
2015-11-16 18:22:55	robink	hosler: At some point in the future, should I show up in the channel and say "Hey hosler: I bought a new foobaz!!!  Is that not special and/or exciting!" and then say "C'mon, you curmudgeon, be polite" when you grumble about the seemingly random trajectory of my exclamation?
2015-11-16 18:23:01	infinmed	My graphic card is 2048 dedicated memory and the gpu hits 810mhz and it was $35 a year ago
2015-11-16 18:23:07	infinmed	It even has cuda cores
2015-11-16 18:23:10	robink	infinmed: Er, "gaming hardcore"?
2015-11-16 18:23:19	infinmed	Yes what is your purpose for that kind of card in linux
2015-11-16 18:23:27	infinmed	I'm curious, is it game development, rendering, what
2015-11-16 18:23:29	robink	infinmed: You mean running Crysis 4 at supar detail settings in 4K?
2015-11-16 18:23:30	+hosler	robink: dude the day you say that is the day u become my best friend
2015-11-16 18:23:35	infinmed	yes robink

2015-11-16 18:24:03	infinmed	Wow
2015-11-16 18:24:17	robink	infinmed: I'm not a "hardcore gamer", and I can usually manage to make most game engines run at decent detail settings on less oomphy hardware.
2015-11-16 18:24:38	infinmed	Well, opencl is implemented like where? Nowhere at this point really
2015-11-16 18:24:41	robink	infinmed: The primary "gruntwork" application would likely be compute and/or offscreen rendering.
2015-11-16 18:24:43	infinmed	Are you just wealthy and want the latency
2015-11-16 18:24:47	robink	infinmed: No
2015-11-16 18:24:54	robink	infinmed: OpenCL is pretty much fully implemented by Mesa+Gallium.
2015-11-16 18:25:04	infinmed	Gallium? As in the web browser?
2015-11-16 18:25:05	robink	infinmed: and is pretty much the forebearer to the successor to OpenGL.
2015-11-16 18:25:15	robink	infinmed: No, Gallium as in the graphics API and intermediate representation.
2015-11-16 18:25:42	infinmed	Well I understand that a proper graphic card uplifts and entire system even for the non gamer and those not rendering real life
2015-11-16 18:25:51	infinmed	I just kind of covered that point although
2015-11-16 18:25:52	infinmed	And you said no
2015-11-16 18:26:00	infinmed	What are you doing with the card? That's all I'm asking
2015-11-16 18:26:10	robink	infinmed: I'm not saying that's definitely the case.  Did you see what *I* said about the Tonga chipset and the AMDGPU driver?
2015-11-16 18:26:16	robink	infinmed: Didn't I already answer that question?
2015-11-16 18:26:19	infinmed	You said it works best yes
2015-11-16 18:26:24	robink	infinmed: Light-duty gaming, offscreen rendering and compute.
2015-11-16 18:26:29	infinmed	To me that's latency
2015-11-16 18:26:29	salviadud	I happen to have opengl with an egl interface on my plasma
2015-11-16 18:26:32	infinmed	How I think
2015-11-16 18:26:35	+Monkeh	Anyone got popcorn?
2015-11-16 18:26:46	salviadud	that opencl you speak of, is it better than opengl?
2015-11-16 18:26:48	robink	infinmed: Heh, works best == latency.  That's a hell of an ontology.
2015-11-16 18:26:51	robink	salviadud: ...
2015-11-16 18:26:53	+iamben	Monkeh: im glad someone showed up and took the heat off me
2015-11-16 18:26:59	robink	infinmed: Also, my apologies if you're trying to playfully troll me; from this end you're coming off as an idiot.
2015-11-16 18:27:02	infinmed	Alright one last question man that will sum up this for me via
2015-11-16 18:27:06	salviadud	haha, forget me.
2015-11-16 18:27:10	infinmed	Are you at 4k
2015-11-16 18:27:12	robink	infinmed: Nope.
2015-11-16 18:27:26	infinmed	Then you're full of shit if you're not rich and you need to save your money
2015-11-16 18:27:35	robink	infinmed: I...wow
2015-11-16 18:27:40	+hosler	omg
2015-11-16 18:27:59	infinmed	He's not gaming, he's not at 4k, he isn't just wanting the latency
2015-11-16 18:28:02	infinmed	what other conclusion can I come to
2015-11-16 18:28:21	 *	robink would share the conclusion he's come to, but doesn't want to come off as crass.

2015-11-16 18:32:04	infinmed	Implicitly to my way of thinking, yes
2015-11-16 18:32:06	+Monkeh	There are uses for modern GPUs other than rendering realtime graphics.

2015-11-19 21:16:01	jam3s2k3	I would like to challenge you to attempt to emulate their dam project any dam time and/or any dam place you choose. I believe I can safely state there is no dam way you could ever match their dam skills, their dam resourcefulness, their dam ingenuity, their dam persistence, their dam determination and/or their dam work ethic.

2015-11-19 21:16:12	shadowdao	scryspc: Colorado is a state in a nation which ostensibly follows UN resolutions.

2015-11-19 21:17:52	jam3s2k3	for the time being, as long as I don't build any unauthorized dams (I may purchase some beavers), then rainwater collection shouldn't bother the state any

2015-11-21 19:22:25	Cheaterman	I don't really know the details, I just get the thing to work :3
2015-11-21 19:22:30	Cheaterman	It's Jython though
2015-11-21 19:22:34	robink	Cheaterman: Ahh
2015-11-21 19:22:39	robink	Cheaterman: Still nice
2015-11-21 19:22:42	Cheaterman	So it's more than just REPL
2015-11-21 19:22:46	Cheaterman	it's an actual Python interpreter
2015-11-21 19:22:51	robink	Cheaterman: Er, well, yes, but you get more than "just REPL" with Clojure.
2015-11-21 19:23:03	Cheaterman	Well I do get more than "just REPL" for sure with Jython ^^
2015-11-21 19:23:18	robink	Cheaterman: Right, but I'm hoping you don't think of Clojure as less than "just REPL"
2015-11-21 19:23:37	robink	Cheaterman: You get not just a full interpreter, but an AOT compiler, plus really nice Java integration.
2015-11-21 19:23:37	Cheaterman	I didn't know what REPL means 3 mins ago
2015-11-21 19:23:49	Cheaterman	Jython compiles AOT too

2015-11-21 19:23:56	robink	Cheaterman: To Java?  Eww.
2015-11-21 19:24:02	robink	Cheaterman: Why not generate Java bytecode?
2015-11-21 19:24:04	Cheaterman	And I can import anything I want from Java too
2015-11-21 19:24:09	robink	Cheaterman: Same with Clojure.
2015-11-21 19:24:12	Cheaterman	That's what it does

2015-11-21 19:24:20	Cheaterman	Why do you misinterpret what I say on purpose x)
2015-11-21 19:24:23	Cheaterman	You're a funny guy
2015-11-21 19:24:28	robink	Cheaterman: Java is the language.
2015-11-21 19:24:35	Cheaterman	I don't understand?
2015-11-21 19:24:48	Cheaterman	Actually I don't care much, it seems like you're trolling :3
2015-11-21 19:24:56	robink	Cheaterman: JVM bytecode is its own spec, and is independent of the Java language.
2015-11-21 19:25:24	robink	Cheaterman: "Java™" is the package of runtime environment, bytecode JIT, Java-language compiler and Java-compatible classpath.
2015-11-21 19:25:38	robink	Cheaterman: I'm not intending to troll.  I might be pedant-ing.
2015-11-21 19:26:10	puddlejumper	i've only used jython for testing
2015-11-21 19:26:18	puddlejumper	i should try it for other things
2015-11-21 19:26:25	Cheaterman	It's 4:26AM, which means I'm really, really not in the mood for dealing with that sort of person :-)
2015-11-21 19:26:49	Cheaterman	Jython is quite slow to start, but it's very fast after that
2015-11-21 19:26:49	robink	Cheaterman: The only invective I might use would be to suggest that when you say "Java" while referring to "everything", or some specific subset of the runtime (especially if it isn't Java proper), you come off as sounding a bit uninformed.
2015-11-21 19:27:03	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: from your name i figured you're always in the mood for all sorts of decept
2015-11-21 19:27:10	robink	Cheaterman: I'm not attacking Jython.  Why are you assuming that I have something against Jython?
2015-11-21 19:27:11	Cheaterman	puddlejumper: :DD
2015-11-21 19:27:22	Cheaterman	robink: Am I though? ;-)
2015-11-21 19:27:29	puddlejumper	deceit rather
2015-11-21 19:27:59	Cheaterman	I know the difference between a binary and a text file, robink, and I believe anyone in this channel does
2015-11-21 19:27:59	puddlejumper	robink: good, it's not wise to attack inanimate objects
2015-11-21 19:28:08	Cheaterman	So why are you like "why not to bytecode" when you precisely know it does
2015-11-21 19:28:23	Cheaterman	It's really an arrogant and unpleasant attitude :-)
2015-11-21 19:28:23	robink	Cheaterman: Actually I didn't; I wasn't sure what Jython compiled down to.
2015-11-21 19:28:34	Cheaterman	Compiling → binaries
2015-11-21 19:28:37	robink	Cheaterman: So you are assuming I know something when I don't, and assuming I don't know something when I do.
2015-11-21 19:28:39	Cheaterman	As far as I'm concerned
2015-11-21 19:28:44	robink	Cheaterman: Well not anymore.
2015-11-21 19:28:48	Cheaterman	Well if you don't know what compiling means, not my fault :3
2015-11-21 19:28:53	robink	Cheaterman: ClojureScript compiles to an interpreted language.
2015-11-21 19:28:59	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: what if you use your own java code with jython bytecode
2015-11-21 19:29:01	robink	Cheaterman: Are you saying that ClojureScript's compiler isn't a compiler?
2015-11-21 19:29:06	Cheaterman	then it doesn't compile, it parses and replaces
2015-11-21 19:29:10	Cheaterman	or rewrites
2015-11-21 19:29:12	puddlejumper	you create your own bas&^rd program
2015-11-21 19:29:24	Cheaterman	puddlejumper: You most certainly can
2015-11-21 19:29:30	Cheaterman	I think that's actually the idea behind Jython
2015-11-21 19:29:30	robink	Cheaterman: but given that it takes an input and creates a not only different, but minified and optimized output, how can you argue that's not compilation?
2015-11-21 19:29:35	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: which is all i've done
2015-11-21 19:29:38	Cheaterman	it's that instead of writing CPython modules which isn't that easy
2015-11-21 19:29:44	Cheaterman	You'd write Jython modules and gain speed too
2015-11-21 19:29:46	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: jython is great for testing my classes
2015-11-21 19:29:57	Cheaterman	Oh yes you use Py.test ?
2015-11-21 19:29:59	Cheaterman	in Java?
2015-11-21 19:30:04	robink	Cheaterman: just because native code isn't coming out doesn't mean the code in question isn't compiled.
2015-11-21 19:30:11	puddlejumper	which can be done with more java with more compiling and such
2015-11-21 19:30:19	Cheaterman	robink: bytecode isn't native by any means, still I call it compilation
2015-11-21 19:30:24	Cheaterman	so now please stop trolling :-)
2015-11-21 19:30:27	Cheaterman	not in the mood as I said
2015-11-21 19:30:41	robink	Cheaterman: Right, but bytecode is arguably an instruction set.  Ergo, a language.
2015-11-21 19:30:43	robink	Cheaterman: I'm not trolling.
2015-11-21 19:30:50	puddlejumper	isn't the point of bytecode so it isn't native
2015-11-21 19:30:59	robink	Cheaterman: If that's too tough on an ontology for you to swallow, you can call languages that compile to other high-level languages transpilers.
2015-11-21 19:31:03	Cheaterman	then binaries are just an interpreted language which is machine code...
2015-11-21 19:31:04	puddlejumper	and the whole point of having an interpreter
2015-11-21 19:31:12	Cheaterman	same nonsense all over again, don't wanna get over this
2015-11-21 19:31:19	robink	Cheaterman: Right, except that in the case of machine code there is no interpreter.
2015-11-21 19:31:23	robink	Cheaterman: So what's interpreting the native code?
2015-11-21 19:31:36	Cheaterman	the CPU, which is an hardware interpreter. we wrote these for LISP too. sigh...
2015-11-21 19:31:58	puddlejumper	robink: interpreter reads bytecode and translates to native code that your system can use
2015-11-21 19:32:03	Cheaterman	puddlejumper: Anyways, you really wanted to use Python to test your stuff that badly? XD
2015-11-21 19:32:26	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: for non-java stuff i use python
2015-11-21 19:32:34	robink	puddlejumper: Sure, except it also memoizes the results and calls back to them when the same code is in use.  A high-level language interpreter doesn't necessarily do that.
2015-11-21 19:32:34	puddlejumper	for java classes i use jython
2015-11-21 19:32:40	Cheaterman	Awesome
2015-11-21 19:32:47	Cheaterman	Sounds like a smooth workflow
2015-11-21 19:33:06	robink	Cheaterman: According to Wikipedia, an interpreter is a computer program.
2015-11-21 19:33:14	puddlejumper	like i said i can do this with more java but it takes more time
2015-11-21 19:33:22	robink	Cheaterman: If you have hardware that's faster at parsing a LISP AST, that's great, it doesn't make it an interpreter.
2015-11-21 19:33:42	+FrostFeline	I thought an inerpreter was a list of suggestiosn :)
2015-11-21 19:34:11	Cheaterman	:DDD
2015-11-21 19:34:22	Cheaterman	puddlejumper: More Java seems like the bad choice always
2015-11-21 19:34:30	Cheaterman	That's why I chose Jython for my Minecraft server
2015-11-21 19:34:36	puddlejumper	i wish i had a lisp interpreter, that guy at work is hard to understand sometimes
2015-11-21 19:34:37	Cheaterman	Developing modules will be more funi

2015-11-21 20:50:01	Cheaterman	Since Jython is a Python interpreter
2015-11-21 20:50:09	Cheaterman	You'd have to use Python before Jython
2015-11-21 20:50:17	puddlejumper	and java 4 years before python

2015-11-22 10:31:45	+FrostFeline	Is plasma mobile an officially supported project?
2015-11-22 10:31:56	+FrostFeline	as in by the KDE devs?
2015-11-22 10:32:38	SpaceToast	https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Mobile
2015-11-22 10:32:54	SpaceToast	the wiki seems to hint towards that, but I can't see any definite yes/no
2015-11-22 10:33:10	+FrostFeline	Android is already pretty free.
2015-11-22 10:34:13	SpaceToast	CM is open source, yeah
2015-11-22 10:34:24	+FrostFeline	Even plain old android has AOSP
2015-11-22 10:34:28	SpaceToast	yus
2015-11-22 10:34:52	+FrostFeline	The thing that bothers people is you have the option to use proprietary software on your phone 8)
2015-11-22 10:35:01	+FrostFeline	and that would be terrible.
2015-11-22 10:35:09	glsubri	first of all I just don't like android. Free or not.
2015-11-22 10:35:24	SpaceToast	which is why I asked specifically what you can do with plasma mobile that you can't with android (e.g CM, because root access is a thing); because glsubri's argument is that he "wants to have an open platform", "be able to do what he wants with his phone" and "prefers freedom over functionality"
2015-11-22 10:35:44	SpaceToast	ok, what don't you like in android that is fixed in plasma mobile?
2015-11-22 10:35:45	glsubri	SpaceToast: thoses are some
2015-11-22 10:35:52	SpaceToast	they are the only ones you mentioned.
2015-11-22 10:35:54	+FrostFeline	loaded questions?
2015-11-22 10:35:54	glsubri	for one : Java
2015-11-22 10:36:09	SpaceToast	no java
2015-11-22 10:36:12	SpaceToast	:P
2015-11-22 10:36:14	AsumFace	seriously? my gcc build failed because i started ntpd?
2015-11-22 10:36:20	+FrostFeline	I think the important bit is what do you want to do in plasma mobile that you can't
2015-11-22 10:36:35	+FrostFeline	and that's going to be different depending on who you ask.
2015-11-22 10:36:43	glsubri	SpaceToast: did you ever make an android app ?
2015-11-22 10:36:51	SpaceToast	glsubri: java SYNTAX.
2015-11-22 10:36:54	SpaceToast	no java runtime.
2015-11-22 10:37:03	SpaceToast	see: libart.so
2015-11-22 10:37:15	SpaceToast	also, it's possible to write in C for android
2015-11-22 10:37:19	SpaceToast	(and python, and C#, and ruby)
2015-11-22 10:37:19	glsubri	yeah
2015-11-22 10:37:25	glsubri	theoretically
2015-11-22 10:37:26	SpaceToast	so.... no java
2015-11-22 10:37:37	SpaceToast	what's stopping you?

2015-11-22 10:38:02	SpaceToast	that's stopping you from writing for android overall
2015-11-22 10:38:09	SpaceToast	and has nothing to do with android specifically
2015-11-22 10:38:17	glsubri	there is actually a nice thing with android. I can write an app using Scala pretty easily
2015-11-22 10:38:24	+FrostFeline	Writing in C seems like a bad idea for android.
2015-11-22 10:38:26	SpaceToast	so... still no java
2015-11-22 10:38:27	glsubri	SpaceToast: it does
2015-11-22 10:38:27	+FrostFeline	generally
2015-11-22 10:38:47	SpaceToast	glsubri: if you don't have the time to write in C for android, how would you have the time to write in C for another similar platform?
2015-11-22 10:38:49	+FrostFeline	Since you lose that hardware independence.
2015-11-22 10:39:00	glsubri	On my laptop, I can make whatever I want, the way I want to do it
2015-11-22 10:39:07	SpaceToast	you can still do that on android
2015-11-22 10:39:18	glsubri	No
2015-11-22 10:39:40	SpaceToast	?
2015-11-22 10:39:49	+FrostFeline	Pretty sure vanilla android has APIs to hook almost everything.
2015-11-22 10:39:53	SpaceToast	^
2015-11-22 10:40:04	glsubri	that is not what I'm talking about
2015-11-22 10:40:10	SpaceToast	what can you do on your laptop
2015-11-22 10:40:14	glsubri	I'm talking about "workflow"

2015-11-22 10:40:46	glsubri	first of all my phone should not be considered diffrently from my laptop
2015-11-22 10:40:57	SpaceToast	is it?
2015-11-22 10:41:03	glsubri	clearly
2015-11-22 10:41:04	SpaceToast	if so, how?
2015-11-22 10:41:06	SpaceToast	ok, how?
2015-11-22 10:41:11	glsubri	^^
2015-11-22 10:41:41	glsubri	there are different levels of differences:
2015-11-22 10:41:53	glsubri	1) the plateforme (in my case, android)
2015-11-22 10:42:15	glsubri	I find it very difficult to write apps for android that do what I want without rewriting a lot
2015-11-22 10:42:33	SpaceToast	android: you mean linux with a runtime (libart, for example) to make sure everything works the same across all very different kinds of phones?
2015-11-22 10:42:42	glsubri	no
2015-11-22 10:42:57	glsubri	I mean the android you get when you buy a phone
2015-11-22 10:42:59	SpaceToast	android has a touchscreen, no keyboard, and many other hardware differences to your laptop which require different approaches in development
2015-11-22 10:43:12	SpaceToast	the pre-installed OS? your laptop probably had windows or OSX pre-installed
2015-11-22 10:43:12	glsubri	and that is normal
2015-11-22 10:43:14	SpaceToast	you can change that
2015-11-22 10:43:22	glsubri	how can you with android ?
2015-11-22 10:43:25	SpaceToast	just like you can change from the OEM android
2015-11-22 10:43:28	SpaceToast	to say, CyanogenMod
2015-11-22 10:43:37	glsubri	yay I changed from android to android
2015-11-22 10:44:03	SpaceToast	your argument is inconsistent
2015-11-22 10:44:06	+FrostFeline	You could change from Android to AOSP and have nothing to whine about
2015-11-22 10:44:12	glsubri	I have AOSP
2015-11-22 10:44:27	glsubri	the thing I'm complaining about is the workflow
2015-11-22 10:44:33	SpaceToast	first I say that android is just linux with a runtime (libart), and you say "the android that you get when you buy a phone"
2015-11-22 10:44:42	SpaceToast	when told you can change that, you complain it's changing from android to android
2015-11-22 10:44:59	SpaceToast	ok, define workflow, and explain what is bad about the one android has
2015-11-22 10:45:00	glsubri	it is hard to have what you want on an android phone, even if you write app for them
2015-11-22 10:45:14	SpaceToast	you are stating things. can you please demonstrate your premise?
2015-11-22 10:45:31	glsubri	how can I change the "google now" and add functionnality to the app ?
2015-11-22 10:45:53	SpaceToast	1. remove google now
2015-11-22 10:45:54	glsubri	I can't, but that is the problem of the app
2015-11-22 10:45:56	SpaceToast	2. write your own version
2015-11-22 10:46:04	glsubri	3, what ?
2015-11-22 10:46:12	SpaceToast	3. use your own version that does what you want?
2015-11-22 10:46:19	glsubri	how do you put it in place ?
2015-11-22 10:46:24	SpaceToast	you install it...?
2015-11-22 10:46:33	+FrostFeline	isn't google now a glorified google search app?
2015-11-22 10:46:36	SpaceToast	it is
2015-11-22 10:46:46	SpaceToast	but if you wanted to write your own version, nothing is stopping yo
2015-11-22 10:46:48	glsubri	and then I swipe up and it automatically opens my app ?
2015-11-22 10:47:00	SpaceToast	and then you edit the WM/DE ;)
2015-11-22 10:47:02	SpaceToast	in the same way
2015-11-22 10:47:06	SpaceToast	so it opens your app automatically
2015-11-22 10:47:08	glsubri	exactly
2015-11-22 10:47:14	glsubri	how do you modify this WM ?
2015-11-22 10:47:20	SpaceToast	you write your own ;)
2015-11-22 10:47:23	+FrostFeline	There are api hooks for that.
2015-11-22 10:47:31	glsubri	exactly
2015-11-22 10:47:38	glsubri	you have to rewrite everything
2015-11-22 10:47:38	SpaceToast	(there probably are too, but just giving an example)
2015-11-22 10:47:46	SpaceToast	or you can get the source for the WM
2015-11-22 10:47:55	SpaceToast	(if it's open, which it PROBABLY IS, since it's part of AOSP)
2015-11-22 10:48:00	SpaceToast	and edit that
2015-11-22 10:48:08	SpaceToast	you would STILL need to do this on your laptop
2015-11-22 10:48:14	SpaceToast	and you would STILL need to do this on plasma mobile
2015-11-22 10:48:17	SpaceToast	I'm not seeing your point
2015-11-22 10:48:20	glsubri	yes, of course
2015-11-22 10:48:24	+FrostFeline	It's probably saner to use the API hooks.
2015-11-22 10:48:32	glsubri	but on my phone, everything is like hidden
2015-11-22 10:48:34	+FrostFeline	Since you have less delta with upstream.
2015-11-22 10:48:43	glsubri	or made so I don't modify things too much
2015-11-22 10:48:48	SpaceToast	except it's not...

2015-11-22 11:01:24	SpaceToast	I mean _anything_
2015-11-22 11:01:27	glsubri	yes
2015-11-22 11:01:31	Smiley	I don't like the weirdnss of javascript.
2015-11-22 11:01:45	SpaceToast	ok. so go ahead and specify

2015-11-22 11:02:18	glsubri	I prefer it because I don't have a lot of constraints
2015-11-22 11:02:46	Smiley	how does android constrain you?
2015-11-22 11:02:59	SpaceToast	glsubri: can you be *specific*
2015-11-22 11:03:04	SpaceToast	for example:
2015-11-22 11:03:30	SpaceToast	"I developed a bare metal hypervisor for arm systems and was happy that I didn't have to link to libraries I didn't know the full contents of since I didn't read them"
2015-11-22 11:03:32	glsubri	One example: it is stupid to edit a xml file for the "design" part of an app and have java next to it
2015-11-22 11:03:41	SpaceToast	1. it's not java.

2015-11-22 11:04:20	SpaceToast	it's not java! it's java SYNTAX
2015-11-22 11:04:30	SpaceToast	moreover you can use any other language (e.g C, Ruby, Python, etc)
2015-11-22 11:04:32	SpaceToast	we've gone over this
2015-11-22 11:04:44	SpaceToast	and you only need ONE XML file (AndroidManifest.xml)
2015-11-22 11:04:48	SpaceToast	you can do the design manually
2015-11-22 11:04:49	glsubri	no you don't
2015-11-22 11:04:55	SpaceToast	yes. you do.
2015-11-22 11:05:07	glsubri	you need a xml file for every different interface you want
2015-11-22 11:05:10	SpaceToast	you instantiate layout elements at runtime.
2015-11-22 11:05:13	SpaceToast	no you don't
2015-11-22 11:05:23	SpaceToast	using XML in UIs is a common theme because it's considered simpler
2015-11-22 11:05:28	SpaceToast	(e.g see Qt Quick)
2015-11-22 11:05:35	SpaceToast	but it's never obligatory (including in Android)
2015-11-22 11:05:57	SpaceToast	here, a 1 minute google searched gave me this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8037203/android-create-app-with-pure-java-and-no-xml

2015-11-22 11:06:16	SpaceToast	just because you don't know how to do it, does not mean it doesn't exist.
2015-11-22 11:07:14	glsubri	really ? you have to point out *this* level of obviousness ?
2015-11-22 11:07:37	SpaceToast	it seems that I have to.
2015-11-22 11:07:54	glsubri	did you ever write an app for android ?
2015-11-22 11:07:54	SpaceToast	because, up to now, you were convinced it was entirely impossible, even though a minute long google search shows it is.
2015-11-22 11:08:07	SpaceToast	are you really asking that question?
2015-11-22 11:08:10	glsubri	yes

2015-11-22 11:09:29	glsubri	When I feel bad about how something works, I just don't use it
2015-11-22 11:09:37	glsubri	and ?
2015-11-22 11:09:48	SpaceToast	the problem is that you were arguing that there are things wrong with android
2015-11-22 11:09:56	SpaceToast	and up to now you have failed to mention a single wrong thing that was also correct
2015-11-22 11:10:16	SpaceToast	you're free not to like something, but if your reason is "because [something that isn't true]", it's silly
2015-11-22 11:10:32	SpaceToast	especially if the same kind of stuff is true of other platforms
2015-11-22 11:10:47	SpaceToast	(e.g you could say "I don't like developing apps", rather than "developing apps on android", and that's fine)
2015-11-22 11:10:49	glsubri	I am not saying there is a better platform actually
2015-11-22 11:10:52	+FrostFeline	I feel like we're getting away from the actual discussion. Is there something wrong with instantiating UI elements at runtime?
2015-11-22 11:10:57	SpaceToast	^
2015-11-22 11:11:09	glsubri	no there isn't ?
2015-11-22 11:11:16	SpaceToast	FrostFeline: his complaint was that he HAD to use XML. He had no idea runtime instantiation existed.

2015-11-22 11:11:36	SpaceToast	so his argument fell apart when I pointed out it is, at which point he went for a "well what about YOU person"

2015-11-22 11:16:18	SpaceToast	I'm pretty sure it tells something about you
2015-11-22 11:16:36	SpaceToast	I was aware that you didn't need a "design" XML, even though I don't exactly work on android day-to-day

2015-11-22 11:16:55	SpaceToast	in this case, it doesn't say much about the platform, because your statement was simply wrong

2015-11-23 03:21:58	+wiktor_b	in your setup it should rock
2015-11-23 03:22:02	mvaenskae	the loads on my builder were immeasurable
2015-11-23 03:22:10	+wiktor_b	also make sure to recheck what -march=native sets after updating gcc
2015-11-23 03:22:15	mvaenskae	even though i sent 100 jobs
2015-11-23 03:22:27	+wiktor_b	clearly you didn't send 100 jobs
2015-11-23 03:22:39	+wiktor_b	set -l in MAKEOPTS for distcc
2015-11-23 03:22:51	mvaenskae	i verified it by checking my builder's process tree
2015-11-23 03:22:56	mvaenskae	and i found a lot more jobs
2015-11-23 03:23:05	+wiktor_b	were they succeeding?
2015-11-23 03:23:25	+wiktor_b	emerge -j for MOAR!! jobs
2015-11-23 03:23:48	mvaenskae	i sure hope so; could having different levels of hardening caused issues?
2015-11-23 03:23:51	+xiaomiao	distcc is in general silly
2015-11-23 03:24:02	mvaenskae	oh wait, that was still on both being hardened
2015-11-23 03:24:55	mvaenskae	wiktor_b: would you be willing to help me out tomorrow with setting up distcc? i am either really too dumb for it or it really is causing too much overhead for my client
2015-11-23 03:25:29	mvaenskae	xiaomiao: how would the chroot look like in the setup and what dirs should be synchronized?
2015-11-23 03:25:38	+xiaomiao	mvaenskae: /etc/portage mostly
2015-11-23 03:25:46	+xiaomiao	mvaenskae: possibly /var/lib/portage/world
2015-11-23 03:25:56	mvaenskae	i am open for both options and could see myself doing some tests on compilations
2015-11-23 03:26:20	mvaenskae	and the bin-packages i guess
2015-11-23 03:26:32	mvaenskae	tests in terms of speedyness
2015-11-23 03:26:35	+wiktor_b	alternatively keep /etc/portage in git
2015-11-23 03:27:01	mvaenskae	true, i should start my own dotfiles-repo
2015-11-23 03:27:15	mvaenskae	different machines have different branches then i guess
2015-11-23 03:27:20	 *	wiktor_b keeps /etc in git
2015-11-23 03:27:43	mvaenskae	git as in github?
2015-11-23 03:27:45	+wiktor_b	no
2015-11-23 03:28:47	+wiktor_b	I have a non-publically-available ssh server for clients to sync up with
2015-11-23 03:29:09	mvaenskae	is it offline or also online?
2015-11-23 03:29:32	+wiktor_b	it's connected to the internet and protected with keys and port knocking
2015-11-23 03:30:29	+wiktor_b	the benefit of this setup is that I can do maintenance on site and thanks to git I can sync both ways
2015-11-23 03:33:18	+wiktor_b	and this way I can generate binpkgs reliably
2015-11-23 03:33:28	mvaenskae	port knocking rings a bell

2015-11-23 03:35:17	mvaenskae	why not use a second factor?

2015-11-23 03:39:09	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: calligra is not "based on KDE"
2015-11-23 03:39:32	mvaenskae	wiktor_b: the description mentions it to be KDE's office suite ;)
2015-11-23 03:39:45	+wiktor_b	it works very well without KDE
2015-11-23 03:40:33	mvaenskae	i will give it a look then later on but right now i will then resort to using opensuse leap in a VM for doing my presentations and exporting them to pdf

2015-11-23 03:48:33	mvaenskae	or not, i just used it wrong
2015-11-23 03:48:49	mvaenskae	J/K or PgUp/Down are used for page-wise jumps in zathura
2015-11-23 03:49:02	+wiktor_b	ach zathura
2015-11-23 03:49:16	+wiktor_b	heard nice things about it, though personally I'm a mupdf guy
2015-11-23 03:49:20	mvaenskae	full page scrolling with <space> doesn't work
2015-11-23 03:49:26	mvaenskae	you can use mupdf as the backend
2015-11-23 03:49:39	mvaenskae	i use the poppler lib for it though
2015-11-23 03:49:47	+wiktor_b	I don't need more of a frontend than what mupdf provides :)
2015-11-23 03:50:06	mvaenskae	it is very vi-like
2015-11-23 03:50:13	+wiktor_b	displays pages, can rotate, / for search, up/down/j/k/pgup/pgdn for scroll
2015-11-23 03:50:15	+wiktor_b	etc etc
2015-11-23 03:50:24	mvaenskae	same for zathura
2015-11-23 03:50:31	mvaenskae	it misses out on one feature though
2015-11-23 03:50:34	mvaenskae	incremental search
2015-11-23 03:50:49	mvaenskae	it searches the whole document first before displaying results :/ needs an extra thread for that
2015-11-23 03:51:08	+wiktor_b	tbf I've never really noticed that :)
2015-11-23 03:51:15	+wiktor_b	I just kinda assume searches take time
2015-11-23 03:51:52	+wiktor_b	though my workstation at work can search 300+ page documents of mixed images, cjk, latin in milliseconds
2015-11-23 03:52:16	+wiktor_b	so yeah I guess just throw money at the problem haha
2015-11-23 03:53:19	mvaenskae	at least that is what i take from the behaviour i experience
2015-11-23 03:53:49	mvaenskae	it blocks and then somehow magically has a list of all instances
2015-11-23 03:54:11	+wiktor_b	nothing wrong with that if you ask me

2015-11-23 07:48:00	Smiley	4 hours, 13minutes to go
2015-11-23 07:48:20	Smiley	So awhile ago I sent a pretty frank email to boss about soem problems, and one of them was 'what exactly is expected when on call'
2015-11-23 07:48:26	Smiley	theres no documentation or anything on this.
2015-11-23 07:48:42	Smiley	The answer is mostly 'fix things and if you can't, escalate it' which is fine
2015-11-23 07:49:07	Smiley	So last night one of the links in the dc was being a bit weird, contacted various people to sorted it
2015-11-23 07:49:33	Smiley	and agreed that while it was odd, it wasn't affecting customers (I tried from home, on the same link that was affected as it's provided by my ISP and there was no issue there).
2015-11-23 07:49:55	Smiley	today it's all 'why didn't you escalate it!!!'
2015-11-23 07:50:08	Smiley	I'm like..... I fixed it. No customers were affected.... what's the problem? -_-;
2015-11-23 07:50:32	+UberPinguin	:(
2015-11-23 07:50:40	+UberPinguin	I'm with you, and that's generally how we handle things here
2015-11-23 07:51:01	+UberPinguin	except that we also have a conf call every morning where I'd be expected to at least mention the issue
2015-11-23 07:51:16	+UberPinguin	"This is what happened, it was fixed, this was the impact." "OK, next."
2015-11-23 07:51:19	Smiley	I'm on the late shift.
2015-11-23 07:51:40	Smiley	I did plan to mention it in the morning, and then only remembered i was on the late shift at 9am
2015-11-23 07:51:44	+UberPinguin	the conf call is for change management and outage discussion, so I'd be expected to call in and represent the issue anyway
2015-11-23 07:52:12	Smiley	The annoying thing is there _wasn't_ any outage
2015-11-23 07:52:22	+UberPinguin	right
2015-11-23 07:52:28	+UberPinguin	imo, you did right
2015-11-23 07:52:40	+UberPinguin	fixed before impacting customers = no need to escalate
2015-11-23 07:52:40	Smiley	'you didn't wake me up to tell me about this outage that wasn't happening!!!!1111oneone'
2015-11-23 07:53:14	Smiley	this is why I'd previously asked what was expected. :/

2015-11-23 07:54:17	Smiley	I'm like wtf is the point of me having the phone, if I just have to escalate everything -_-;

2015-11-23 08:21:12	+Milo-	UberPinguin call them "useless"
2015-11-23 08:21:20	+Milo-	"useless engineers"
2015-11-23 08:21:42	+Milo-	UberPinguin actually, your suggestion for the term would be funny if it wasn't so real.
2015-11-23 08:21:52	+UberPinguin	right?
2015-11-23 08:22:29	+Milo-	we don't have cleaners anymore. we have sanitation consultants and sanitation agents.
2015-11-23 08:22:40	+UberPinguin	I disagree about useless, though. SOMEONE has to convince people to buy the things we build/support, so we can draw a salary
2015-11-23 08:22:53	+UberPinguin	Milo-: "environmental engineers" I kid you not
2015-11-23 08:22:57	+Milo-	yep.
2015-11-23 08:23:29	+Milo-	also secretaries cannot be called secretaries anymore.. "Management Assistant" is a lot better sounding title for the same work.
2015-11-23 08:23:58	+doc235	ok i have a problem. as i said earlier my GF couldn't get WWE.com to play last night. it was going along fine and all was workign and it just stopped. on tryig to reconnect it gave media errors as stated earlier. so i tried it on a customers windows computer and it works. is it an adobe-flash problem?
2015-11-23 08:23:59	+Milo-	there are some others which I cannot be bothered to translate to english
2015-11-23 08:24:02	+iamben	im going in the other direction, changing my title from IT Director to Computer Janitor
2015-11-23 08:24:12	+iamben	to more closely reflect reality
2015-11-23 08:24:15	+Milo-	iamben :D

2015-11-23 08:25:15	Smiley	or have screwed it up
2015-11-23 08:25:33	+Milo-	we cannot use the title "software engineer", because we have one employee who graduated from university with master's degree in something else than engineering.
2015-11-23 08:25:52	+Milo-	because of that, our title is "software designer"
2015-11-23 08:26:11	+UberPinguin	Milo-: my title is Technology Engineer. I don't have a degree.

2015-11-23 08:27:33	+UberPinguin	Milo-: honestly, I think that's a good thing
2015-11-23 08:27:39	+UberPinguin	the 'engineer' title is badly diluted in the US
2015-11-23 08:27:42	+doc235	some states here disallow engineer without a degree in it
2015-11-23 08:27:46	brightheart	oh please, any dude or lady worth half their weight could sit in front of a laptop and learn to make it do things - voila, engineer

2015-11-23 08:28:19	+UberPinguin	Milo-: right, to my mind 'designer' is someone who works on UI/UX
2015-11-23 08:28:21	+Milo-	by default, all designers should tortured and killed. All designers have tendencies to torture other people with stupidity.

2015-11-23 21:48:34	robink	FrostFeline: Regarding the Linsay: I'd make sure it could run more than just Android.
2015-11-23 21:49:08	Kellios	I think the Quantum is my best bet.
2015-11-23 21:49:09	+FrostFeline	and now we're on machines for robink ^_^
2015-11-23 21:49:13	robink	FrostFeline: Haha
2015-11-23 21:49:26	+FrostFeline	robink: It's very hard to talk about general cases without projecting
2015-11-23 21:49:32	robink	FrostFeline: Of course.
2015-11-23 21:50:00	robink	FrostFeline: and the other thing is being able to put Gentoo on a tablet/ARM-laptop doesn't mean you'll get a nice swath of writing tools.
2015-11-23 21:50:07	robink	FrostFeline: (necessarily)
2015-11-23 21:50:09	+FrostFeline	Eh.
2015-11-23 21:50:21	robink	FrostFeline: I don't know how you do your writing, is what I'm really saying.
2015-11-23 21:50:26	+FrostFeline	I guess it depends on whether GNU/Linux has gfx drivers for that chip.
2015-11-23 21:50:36	robink	FrostFeline: If you're all about writing LaTeX in Vim, then n/m.
2015-11-23 21:50:37	+FrostFeline	I don't do writing.

2015-11-23 21:50:50	robink	FrostFeline: Ah, OK
2015-11-23 21:51:09	Kellios	I've been writing on a Microsoft Surface
2015-11-23 21:51:16	+FrostFeline	robink: What's the formatting like in LaTeX on a VTY?
2015-11-23 21:51:24	robink	FrostFeline: VTY?
2015-11-23 21:51:24	Kellios	but I think I'd be better working on a real desktop with a real monitor.
2015-11-23 21:51:31	Kellios	My posture has suffered.
2015-11-23 21:51:41	+FrostFeline	robink: Ctrl-Alt-F1-6
2015-11-23 21:51:56	robink	FrostFeline: Oh, just like formatting in LaTeX on tty7 (or 4, depending on your setup).
2015-11-23 21:52:02	robink	FrostFeline: since it's done nominally via a text editor.
2015-11-23 21:52:07	robink	FrostFeline: (unless you use LyX)
2015-11-23 21:52:32	+FrostFeline	robink: Well LaTeX is just specially formatted .txt, but do you get any sort of wysiwyg?
2015-11-23 21:52:36	robink	FrostFeline: So if you were serious about writing (La)TeX, I'd do it on whatever textual interface you were most comfortable with.
2015-11-23 21:52:41	robink	FrostFeline: You do if you use tools like LyX.
2015-11-23 21:53:09	robink	FrostFeline: (Open|Libre)Office will also export Writer documents to LaTeX, but they're not designed for writing LaTeX documents, so the export isn't always perfect.
2015-11-23 21:53:16	robink	FrostFeline: Scribus might export LaTeX, I haven't checked.
2015-11-23 21:53:17	+FrostFeline	robink: It renders correctly that way? What is it? FramebufferDirect?
2015-11-23 21:53:22	robink	FrostFeline: Haha
2015-11-23 21:53:28	robink	FrostFeline: The text renders just fine over the pty.
2015-11-23 21:53:40	robink	FrostFeline: If you want to see the finished output you normally fire up an X11 server.
2015-11-23 21:53:57	robink	FrostFeline: Or, I suppose you can use a DVI viewer that outputs to FB (I think they still exist) or scrounge up a Wayland app.
2015-11-23 21:54:25	robink	FrostFeline: LyX, [LO]Oo, and Scribus are all nominally X11 apps.
2015-11-23 21:54:36	robink	FrostFeline: It might be possible to run LOo on Wayland these days, I honestly haven't tried.
2015-11-23 21:54:39	+FrostFeline	robink: Seems like a wayland setup could be pretty minimal about it.

2015-11-23 21:54:45	robink	FrostFeline: Scribus, probably not (at least not without XWayland), but I could be wrong.
2015-11-23 21:54:48	Kellios	Look at the reviews here.
2015-11-23 21:54:51	Kellios	100% positive.
2015-11-23 21:55:08	+FrostFeline	Also $40 more on amazon.
2015-11-23 21:55:43	robink	FrostFeline: Actually, if you're running Scribus 1.5 compiled with Qt5 support, Wayland might a possibility.  If so, again, haven't looked into it.

2015-11-23 21:57:44	+FrostFeline	Those seem like a gimmick.
2015-11-23 21:58:27	+FrostFeline	You either have to carry around an extra screen for the stick or only use it where there are already HDMI monitors/TVs

2015-11-23 22:29:33	Kellios	But Prime has a subscription fee
2015-11-23 22:29:37	Kellios	I don't want to pay $80/yr.
2015-11-23 22:29:55	+FrostFeline	Well prime just gives you the shipping benefits.
2015-11-23 22:30:24	Kellios	What's the main benefit, faster shipping?
2015-11-23 22:30:24	+FrostFeline	Maybe we get priority on the prices? I don't know.
2015-11-23 22:30:35	+FrostFeline	The main benefit is faster shipping
2015-11-23 22:30:44	+FrostFeline	You also get access to the streaming video service.
2015-11-23 22:31:02	+FrostFeline	Obviously it only makes sense if you buy a lot of things on amazon.
2015-11-23 22:31:05	Kellios	Yeah, the main thing seems to be the shipping.
2015-11-23 22:31:11	Kellios	I don't usually care about shipping speed.
2015-11-23 22:31:24	+FrostFeline	You can definitely save money on shipping if you buy enough things.
2015-11-23 22:31:34	Kellios	Yes. That's what they count on
2015-11-23 22:31:35	+FrostFeline	I buy /all/ the things.
2015-11-23 22:31:46	Kellios	people with prime because they get free 2-day shipping will shop a lot more.
2015-11-23 22:32:10	Kellios	I don't need more of an incentive to order things I don't need.
2015-11-23 22:32:20	+FrostFeline	Well I can go to microcenter and get the same things.
2015-11-23 22:32:48	+FrostFeline	or ebay or other places
2015-11-23 22:32:53	Kellios	Does microcenter have a Canadian branch?
2015-11-23 22:33:00	+FrostFeline	dunno
2015-11-23 22:33:03	Kellios	I ordered something from America last week that had a $50 customs fee on it
2015-11-23 22:33:17	+FrostFeline	ouch
2015-11-23 22:33:28	+FrostFeline	We get stuff from china practically for free
2015-11-23 22:33:33	+FrostFeline	e-packet delivery
2015-11-23 22:33:46	Kellios	Why would customs from USA be so much when you get stuff from China for free?
2015-11-23 22:34:02	+FrostFeline	Some sort of trade deal? I didn't look into it.
2015-11-23 22:34:20	+FrostFeline	Everything is made in china anyway, so maybe they stuff your order into a corner :p
2015-11-23 22:35:14	+FrostFeline	I wonder what the difference betweent he two monitors is that justifies a 300USD price difference?
2015-11-23 22:35:22	Kellios	Which two?
2015-11-23 22:36:01	+FrostFeline	The HP 22xi and 22xw

2015-11-23 22:41:36	Kellios	Someone said it's cheaply made in a review.
2015-11-23 22:41:42	+FrostFeline	Well it has a plastic backing.
2015-11-23 22:41:47	+Chainsaw	It must be true if you read it on the internet.
2015-11-23 22:41:54	+FrostFeline	But its not like I physically stress test it.
2015-11-23 22:42:03	+FrostFeline	It's a monitor that sits on a desk
2015-11-23 22:42:24	+FrostFeline	The stand is made of plastic bits that latch together.
2015-11-23 22:42:46	+FrostFeline	And if it's on a wobbly table,  the monitor will shake on the stand a bit.
2015-11-23 22:43:36	+Chainsaw	So it's not rated for use during earthquakes.

2015-11-24 14:48:08	salviadud	back in 2004
2015-11-24 14:48:15	Cheaterman	salviadud: Python so awesome owii
2015-11-24 14:48:21	hosler	python is great
2015-11-24 14:48:26	salviadud	calculating dependencies took so long, until we upgraded it.
2015-11-24 14:48:40	salviadud	you see guys, python is written in C
2015-11-24 14:48:44	hosler	i love it when i say python is great and other people are like "eewww" and their main complaint is the tabs
2015-11-24 14:48:56	hosler	facepalms all around
2015-11-24 14:48:58	+SpaceToast	CPython is written in C*
2015-11-24 14:49:08	Cheaterman	Yes
2015-11-24 14:49:14	Cheaterman	and Jython in..

2015-11-24 14:49:22	hosler	Jif#
2015-11-24 14:49:34	+daniel2	is there like an src_postinstall?
2015-11-24 14:49:39	+SpaceToast	You could write Python in Python (and I think someone should)
2015-11-24 14:49:41	Cheaterman	hosler: exactly
2015-11-24 14:49:49	Cheaterman	hosler: soooo facepalm
2015-11-24 14:50:01	+iamben	daniel2: there are a few things LIKE that, what are you trying to do?
2015-11-24 14:50:02	hosler	and they hate it sooo much

2015-11-24 14:50:07	Cheaterman	and get cracking
2015-11-24 14:50:17	+daniel2	I need to run glib-compile-schemas "/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/" after this package installs
2015-11-24 14:50:33	Cheaterman	SpaceToast: it exists
2015-11-24 14:50:38	+SpaceToast	Oh?
2015-11-24 14:51:01	hosler	isnt everything bootstrapped these days?
2015-11-24 14:51:04	+SpaceToast	Anyway I'm gonna pass out. I feel absolutely terrible :/
2015-11-24 14:51:12	+iamben	daniel2: you probably want pkg_postinst, it is pkg_ because you want the phase run for source builds AND binary installs
2015-11-24 14:51:13	hosler	nighty night

2015-11-24 15:57:14	Cheaterman	cross compile ftw
2015-11-24 15:57:24	mvaenskae	cross-compiling is really slow i was told

2015-11-24 15:57:39	Cheaterman	but it does usually work
2015-11-24 15:58:03	mvaenskae	only way to actually get it compiling correctly -> emulate the pi's hardware and compile inside the emulation
2015-11-24 15:58:14	Cheaterman	ie slower than actual xcompile
2015-11-24 15:58:26	mvaenskae	personal experience with the cross compilation?
2015-11-24 15:58:31	Cheaterman	→ works
2015-11-24 15:58:45	Cheaterman	→ gentoo most likely best OS for it

2015-11-24 15:59:46	Cheaterman	there's a whole wiki page about cross compiling
2015-11-24 15:59:52	Cheaterman	or at least there was when I tried it

2015-11-24 16:03:43	Cheaterman	move that cable to your PC

2015-11-24 16:07:09	mvaenskae	personally i would love to start with a stage1
2015-11-24 16:07:09	Cheaterman	ie the more visible power is, the better it is?
2015-11-24 16:07:13	Cheaterman	should get a lava-based LAN
2015-11-24 16:07:23	mvaenskae	and that requires a lot of time and setup
2015-11-24 16:07:46	mvaenskae	and that is not really something i want to do with the pi
2015-11-24 16:08:37	mvaenskae	still, how would the builder know what package to build?

2015-11-24 16:12:15	Cheaterman	sudo --i-ARM-your master
2015-11-24 16:12:59	mvaenskae	that's an interesting sudo command, must be super powerful if it breaks into my desktop from my pi ;)
2015-11-24 16:13:27	Cheaterman	:D

2015-11-26 16:55:06	_anomaly_	ah right ;)
2015-11-26 16:55:20	_anomaly_	yer i don't really have a problem with the base language
2015-11-26 16:55:48	_anomaly_	there are a few core principles i think are responsible for the mess it's become though
2015-11-26 16:55:53	mvaenskae	oh, that is quite ugly; that's why i didn't understand it
2015-11-26 16:56:15	mvaenskae	i personally think that java is a good general purpose programming language
2015-11-26 16:56:46	_anomaly_	imo the day ruby can actually do proper threads, it'll be a far better language.
2015-11-26 16:57:05	_anomaly_	inb4 someone mistakes 'ruby' for 'rails' specifically and argues against that
2015-11-26 16:57:18	_anomaly_	rails is a mess
2015-11-26 16:57:20	mvaenskae	i have no idea what the difference between these 2 is
2015-11-26 16:57:37	jerichowasahoax	_anomaly_: what's wrong with ruby threads?
2015-11-26 16:57:42	_anomaly_	jerichowasahoax: they don't exist
2015-11-26 16:57:58	jerichowasahoax	ok yeah that's a problem
2015-11-26 16:58:03	mvaenskae	i find any language these days equally broken, especially if one cannot speak it or uses it for the wrong purpose
2015-11-26 16:58:31	_anomaly_	ruby has a single global interpreter lock, everything is single-threaded, it emulates threads using what it calls 'green threads' but they don't really run concurrently
2015-11-26 16:58:45	_anomaly_	so the workaround people use is whole new ruby processes and some form of IPC
2015-11-26 16:58:58	mvaenskae	if someone can write a multithreaded http-server in java nicely then i am happy about the product :)
2015-11-26 16:59:04	_anomaly_	which works but introduces some epic bottlenecks
2015-11-26 16:59:10	mvaenskae	if he tried it with no c++ skills i would likely never use it
2015-11-26 16:59:52	mvaenskae	why would you want to parallelise something if the language officially doesn't support it
2015-11-26 17:00:01	mvaenskae	don't work against the language
2015-11-26 17:00:07	jerichowasahoax	i like the things generated by python's "threading" module

2015-11-26 17:00:40	jerichowasahoax	even if they aren't real threads, they cause me to be able to actually do more than one thing at once per script, so i'm not upset over it
2015-11-26 17:01:10	_anomaly_	actually, this:
2015-11-26 17:01:13	_anomaly_	"Now, there’s a lot confusion surrounding Ruby’s multithreading capabilities. Especially, with regards to all the changes between 1.8 and 1.9. So, let’s be absolutely clear: MRI Ruby does in fact support native threads. Prior to 1.9, only green threads used to be supported. Since Ruby 1.9 this isn’t true anymore: Nowadays, Ruby supports real OS-level threads."
2015-11-26 17:01:18	_anomaly_	but then
2015-11-26 17:01:26	_anomaly_	"While all of this sounds great in theory, parallelism isn’t possible in practice due the Global Interpreter Lock. The GIL is mechanism built directly into the interpreter to ensure that two threads belonging the same Ruby process can never be executed in parallel.
2015-11-26 17:01:30	_anomaly_	So, basically we are back to square one: It seems like we just lost all the advantages provided by the native threads in 1.9"
2015-11-26 17:01:33	_anomaly_	so..... loltime
2015-11-26 17:01:51	_anomaly_	someone did work to implement os-level threads.... only to have them completely  unable to run concurrently
2015-11-26 17:01:54	_anomaly_	derp
2015-11-26 17:01:58	mvaenskae	_anomaly_: thanks, i know to not touch ruby :)
2015-11-26 17:02:03	mvaenskae	at least now
2015-11-26 17:02:15	_anomaly_	ruby is still great, just not for anything threaded
2015-11-26 17:02:27	_anomaly_	unless you want to resort to multi-process and ipc

2015-11-26 18:21:31	_anomaly_	and then you say 'because it's udp, like you asked for'
2015-11-26 18:21:55	_anomaly_	'the packets are coming out at my end, problem mus be transit'
2015-11-26 18:21:59	_anomaly_	*must

2015-12-01 21:00:14	vdevatman	hi there, which would be the max amount of time recommended without upgrading kernel?
2015-12-01 21:13:53	+Griz64	vdevatman, aren't you running Gentoo?
2015-12-01 21:17:43	vdevatman	Griz64: i am
2015-12-01 21:19:16	vdevatman	Griz64: but i'm running 3.14.14-gentoo , and was wondering how bad it could be, i've already emerged linux-4.1.12-gentoo with emerge -DuNav @world, though but haven't compiled/installed it properly
2015-12-01 21:21:01	+Griz64	vdevatman, well, if portage thinks the kernel should be update, 'I' would STRONGLY recommend it.
2015-12-01 21:21:34	vdevatman	Griz64: portage thinks the kernel should be upgraded almost once in two weeks xD
2015-12-01 21:21:43	+Griz64	and?

2015-12-01 21:22:50	vdevatman	Griz64: i don't like to do things without understanding why i'm doing them
2015-12-01 21:23:02	_anomaly_	pedants
2015-12-01 21:25:45	+Griz64	vdevatman, then read the CHANGELOG and find out WHY it was recommended. you need to understand, by using a distro with a 'package manager', you've agreed to let a group of people help you along and watch out for you. some are very good. others, not so much. but when it comes to kernels, i'd grown to trust that chosen few, very well. if they feel a kernel needs change, it's implemented. if it is later determined 'unworthy', it's QUICKLY rectified.
2015-12-01 21:28:22	vdevatman	Griz64: ok, thanks
2015-12-01 21:28:49	+Griz64	vdevatman, do you 'roll yer own' or genkernel?
2015-12-01 21:29:27	vdevatman	Griz64: i used genkernel to make an initramfs i not longer need but everything else was set through --menuconfig
2015-12-01 21:30:08	+Griz64	(shrug) then, either way, it's simple enough.
2015-12-01 21:30:43	soloslinger	vdevatman: You can get by quite a while with an old kernel.  Usually what drives me to the reboot is that the subsequent packages require a kernel feature.  Lots of folk in this channel will flaunt uptimes in the years - meaning they didn't reboot.
2015-12-01 21:31:01	vdevatman	i always get a kernel panic when trying to get rid of initramfs, but i suspect it is because of UUID use and changing to PARTUUID would do the trhick but i don't feel confortable messing with that xD

2015-12-01 21:34:03	soloslinger	vdevatman: I haven't played with initramfs, so I can't speak to that.  But, if it's a kernel issue, it maybe is?
2015-12-01 21:34:05	vdevatman	s/trhick/trick/
2015-12-01 21:35:04	soloslinger	vdevatman: That being said, to parrot other Gentoo Devs in here:  Uptime only means you haven't patched and you have all those subsequent vulnerabilities still on your system.
2015-12-01 21:35:22	vdevatman	soloslinger: i think that i needed initramfs because i wanted to use UUID and kernel can't read UUID by its own, but apparently can read PARTUUID by its own, but I can't be sure since i haven't fixed my issue and don't feel confortable with that, i do backups with tar files i can recover easily but... still is an amazing lost of time xD
2015-12-01 21:36:22	vdevatman	soloslinger: isn't there any way of (for example) reboot the kernel maintaining all the rest of the system on ram/disk maybe like "hibernating" all those parts?
2015-12-01 21:37:01	soloslinger	vdevatman: I know ksplice does something along those lines.  Though I'm not the person smart enough to tell you how they go about doing that or if it's legit.
2015-12-01 21:37:28	soloslinger	vdevatman: Why are you removing initramfs?  Usually that's a desirable thing?
2015-12-01 21:37:48	catpigger	ksplice replaces part of the running kernel
2015-12-01 21:38:09	vdevatman	soloslinger: i use a very minimalistic system and initramfs shouldn't be required
2015-12-01 21:38:26	catpigger	it's used to fix *some* issues (only or largely security bugs) without having to reboot
2015-12-01 21:38:36	soloslinger	vdevatman: Did you build your system using the genkernel path for the kernel issues?
2015-12-01 21:39:04	vdevatman	soloslinger: i used genkernel to make the initramfs but used --menuconfig for everything else
2015-12-01 21:39:08	soloslinger	catpigger: Huh.  Yeah.  I don't know enough about it/them.  Just know "it exists".
2015-12-01 21:39:54	catpigger	soloslinger, yeah, what i just wrote is pretty much all i know about it. it's really not relevant for most people
2015-12-01 21:39:55	soloslinger	vdevatman: Hmm.  I'm not sure how to back pedal out of that, but it should be doable.  That might be a question for the folks in #gentoo.
2015-12-01 21:41:33	vdevatman	soloslinger: yes, but i just wanted to know the most accepted opinion of which should be the max amount of time without upgrading kernel, and didn't see it as a issue which needed support (which i think #gentoo is for) that's why i commented it here xP
2015-12-01 21:42:10	soloslinger	vdevatman:  iirc, initramfs is used to stage a filesystem in for a few special things in ram instead of disk at boot time.  Meaning faster boot.  If your kernel is panicking, it sounds like the bootloader is finding the kernel, but not finding what it needs next in the boot sequence to complete.
2015-12-01 21:42:13	catpigger	vdevatman, well, primary concern in that regard is imho security. new kernels not only bring new features but also security fixes. running uptimes of several years seems a little unprofessional to me
2015-12-01 21:42:45	soloslinger	vdevatman: What catpigger said.
2015-12-01 21:43:24	catpigger	because it means you are running the known security holes of several years. there might be ways to mitigate the risks - but i haven't gotten that far into sysadmining to comment on whether those mitigations cover everything
2015-12-01 21:44:00	vdevatman	soloslinger: i suspect it doesn't find the partitions because i use UUIDs to locate them and i guess that using PARTUUID should fix that without using initramfs (at least i was told that in #gentoo some time ago)
2015-12-01 21:44:02	catpigger	but then at a previous employer we were still running debian3 when debian 7 was about to come out, so.... ;)

2015-12-01 21:44:57	vdevatman	catpigger: actually what makes me wonder which would be the max amount of time without upgrading kernel is mostly because of systems like debian, which uses very very old kernel versions as "stable"
2015-12-01 21:45:41	vdevatman	(well what makes me wondering it besides of my frustration because of "unavoidable" kernel panics xDD)
2015-12-01 21:45:52	catpigger	vdevatman, they dont. they issue kernel updates regularly, too - they just dont issue major upgrades, they just make small ones that include only important and safe patches (ofc "important" and "safe" are not scientific terms in this context)
2015-12-01 21:45:54	soloslinger	vdevatman: I guess to speak to your question then, I update my gentoo kernels about when I have a few free moments to make it happen.  But I don't run production gentoo systems in my day job.
2015-12-01 21:46:00	 *	soloslinger is sad in the pants.
2015-12-01 21:46:41	catpigger	e.g. the debian i'm working is on 3.16.0-4. i believe the -4 indicates the debian-specific patch level (so in gentoo it would be 3.16.0-r4)
2015-12-01 21:47:02	vdevatman	catpigger: i installed a debian not so long ago and it was 3.18 kernel's version, it seemed quite old to me
2015-12-01 21:47:23	catpigger	vdevatman, the *major* version (the 3.18) is rather old indeed
2015-12-01 21:47:33	soloslinger	vdevatman: They are.  But, their design & intent is different.
2015-12-01 21:47:37	catpigger	but it won't be 3.18.0. it'll be like 3.18.47 or something
2015-12-01 21:47:47	+jrunyon	lol my gentoo box is still on 3.18.11 :D
2015-12-01 21:48:04	catpigger	i update my kernel whenever gentoo removes the ebuild for my current one from the tree
2015-12-01 21:48:05	+jrunyon	i have 4.3.0 ready, just cbf to reboot
2015-12-01 21:48:22	catpigger	with the recent changes from grsecurity/paxteam/whatever unfortunately that will probably be more frequent
2015-12-01 21:48:55	+jrunyon	how do you even view what ebuilds there are?
2015-12-01 21:48:56	catpigger	say, i dont suppose anyone would have any kind of pointer on what i could do if a touch screen registers taps and moves the cursor to the tapped location, but not click?
2015-12-01 21:49:23	catpigger	jrunyon, well, i get my notification because after every update i also run emerge @installed -pv
2015-12-01 21:49:32	+jrunyon	ah
2015-12-01 21:49:39	catpigger	that gives a list of remerging all installed packages - so if the ebuild has been removed, it'll complain

2015-12-01 22:11:27	arvut	but some house is really good
2015-12-01 22:11:38	arvut	and I do digg jazz as well
2015-12-01 22:11:57	arvut	mostly older jazz, monk for example
2015-12-01 22:12:37	arvut	but st. germain is a island in the west indies, right?
2015-12-01 22:12:52	soloslinger	Geographically?  I'd have to go back to wikipedia to find out.
2015-12-01 22:12:59	arvut	I think so
2015-12-01 22:14:20	soloslinger	Anyway.  I gotta crash.  It's my time.

2015-12-02 02:42:46	+wiktor_b	the server is nice, very difficult to misconfigure
2015-12-02 02:43:04	 *	lejonet has heard good things about dropbear, but never really looked into it
2015-12-02 02:43:53	+wiktor_b	lejonet: it's a minimalistic ssh2-only server+client
2015-12-02 02:44:08	+wiktor_b	very easy to configure, few options so you can't really screw up
2015-12-02 02:44:18	+wiktor_b	the only thing that's really "missing" is x forwarding in the server
2015-12-02 02:44:27	+lejonet	wiktor_b: nice, does it have support for LDAP?
2015-12-02 02:45:46	+wiktor_b	you can use pam
2015-12-02 02:46:12	+lejonet	ah, so you don't have to separately jack into LDAP like with openssh?
2015-12-02 02:46:15	+wiktor_b	so if you can get pam to work with ldap, you can get dropbear working with ldap
2015-12-02 02:46:44	+lejonet	even with authorized_keys stored in ldap? Because that is the part where you need to separately jack into LDAP with ssh iirc
2015-12-02 02:46:55	+lejonet	s/ssh/openssh/
2015-12-02 02:46:59	+wiktor_b	tbh I've never tried using dropbear with ldap, but pretty sure if you have pam set up with ldap, USE=pam emerge dropbear and you should be set
2015-12-02 02:47:47	+wiktor_b	hmm, ok now that's something I've never even thought about, so you'd have to be the one to find out :)
2015-12-02 02:48:03	+wiktor_b	you don't have to uninstall openssh to try out dropbear, just run it on a different port
2015-12-02 02:48:25	+lejonet	Because the pam intergration for keyboard-interactive should work with just the pam modules being setup properly
2015-12-02 02:48:34	+lejonet	wiktor_b: ofc :)
2015-12-02 02:49:06	+lejonet	as if anything uses the pam stack for auth, it shouldn't need to worry about anything of that, as that is the purpose of pam iirc :P
2015-12-02 02:49:20	+wiktor_b	yeah, I'm not sure about the keys, though
2015-12-02 02:50:18	+monk	hmmm, i wonder if there's anyway to hack android games
2015-12-02 02:50:45	+lejonet	Might be something to look up, maybe it can use the "old school" way, which used a authorized_keys command, which called an LDAP wrapper to fetch the key until lpk was invented, which made openssh able to do so itself
2015-12-02 02:51:03	+lejonet	monk: most likely

2015-12-02 06:16:17	kollapse	daniel2, it could be isolated to kuickshow, but I am not sure. I could gear up another re-emerge to paste the error

2015-12-02 06:40:05	SpaceToast	lol
2015-12-02 06:40:08	SpaceToast	it's not a segfault or anything
2015-12-02 06:40:11	+iamben	we know what changed and what needs fixing
2015-12-02 06:40:41	mvaenskae	ah, i just was intrigueed by "shouldn't that be caught during compile time" :)
2015-12-02 06:41:03	+iamben	unfortunately it is imlib which needs fixed (not imlib2) and imlib hasnt seen a release in over 10 years
2015-12-02 06:41:14	kollapse	mvaenskae, your detective senses, eh ? :)
2015-12-02 06:41:22	+daniel2	sounds like programs need to migrate to imlib2
2015-12-02 06:41:26	SpaceToast	mvaenskae: it is a bit confusing... they might be loading giflib dynamically (rather than just linking to it) which is kinda weird
2015-12-02 06:41:38	SpaceToast	oh
2015-12-02 06:41:51	SpaceToast	kollapse: if it's imlib-specific (and not imlib2) feh would work fine ;)
2015-12-02 06:42:05	mvaenskae	kollapse: i have a course on compiler design so i was wondering what the issue should have been :)
2015-12-02 06:42:34	mvaenskae	daniel2: must be a red hat enterprise project ;)
2015-12-02 06:42:49	mvaenskae	still gotta support those ultra lts versions :D
2015-12-02 06:42:54	SpaceToast	mvaenskae: I'm guessing it's a case of this: http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/dl-libraries.html
2015-12-02 06:43:00	kollapse	iamben, SpaceToast, wow, that worked. downgraded giflib to 4.1.6-r3
2015-12-02 06:43:08	kollapse	thanks for the mighty help! :)
2015-12-02 06:43:29	kollapse	I guess there are better chances for kuickshow to switch to imlib2 than to change imlib1
2015-12-02 06:43:30	SpaceToast	mvaenskae: which is rather unusual, imo, considering it should be a link (not a big deal since runtime references aren't that heavy for small things like this)
2015-12-02 06:43:36	+iamben	there is a patch on that first bug against imlib that will allow it to work with newer giflib, if youre interested

2015-12-02 06:45:47	kollapse	well that patch could be added tot the ebuild, no ?
2015-12-02 06:46:01	mvaenskae	SpaceToast: hm, my course is an introductory course so i cannot state when the dynamic linking should be done, but an educated guess would make me believe issues arising from dynamic linking can only be found out at runtime
2015-12-02 06:46:16	+iamben	in theory yeah, in practice it sounds like imlib is abandoned upstream and downstream (gentoo)
2015-12-02 06:46:20	SpaceToast	mvaenskae: there are two kinds of dynamic linking.
2015-12-02 06:46:21	mvaenskae	as before that one doesn't know the proper behaviour of the program
2015-12-02 06:46:32	SpaceToast	mvaenskae: there's the dlopen kind (that I linked) and the one that involves the linker ;)
2015-12-02 06:46:46	SpaceToast	the one that involves the linker usually gets caught link-time (aka general area of compiling time)
2015-12-02 06:46:54	SpaceToast	dlopen only gets caught during runtime

2015-12-02 06:47:33	mvaenskae	i don't know the definite pros/cons of either so as mentioned i can only guess
2015-12-02 06:47:42	SpaceToast	with "proper" linking, the linker goes through every reference, goes through the libraries being linked, finds the reference, and ties it.
2015-12-02 06:47:52	SpaceToast	mvaenskae: to see all the "proper" links, ldd some_binary
2015-12-02 06:47:55	SpaceToast	:D
2015-12-02 06:48:37	SpaceToast	the advantage of dlopen is that you don't need to load up the reference ahead of time, so if you have 9000 "modules" all of which are non-trivial in size, it'll increase startup time and decrease memory usage until we get to them
2015-12-02 06:48:48	SpaceToast	the disadvantage is that stuff like that happen ;)

2015-12-02 10:52:14	arvut	right, I just read the description of it, its off when building with hardened due to some PaX protection functions
2015-12-02 10:52:51	arvut	altho I'm on a hardened profile, can some pkgs like ff be built unhardened?
2015-12-02 10:53:05	arvut	or would that also cause issues?
2015-12-02 10:54:04	arvut	I don't run on a hardened kernel, so there is no PaX anyway, but the hardened features include some other securityfeatures iirc
2015-12-02 10:54:34	+iamben	sounds like you might not have any idea what you are actually getting from hardened =)

2015-12-02 13:16:07	+bonsaikitten	youtube is video, and some preview thumbnails

2015-12-02 13:18:51	Cheaterman	so without JS you don't have a player
2015-12-02 13:18:53	Cheaterman	so you don't have YT
2015-12-02 13:19:01	+wiktor_b	their html5 player didn't need js a year back or so
2015-12-02 13:19:07	jesuisb	no, you dont have an in-browser player. doesnt mean you cant get the video data
2015-12-02 13:19:22	deathlire	turn off pepperflash/adobe and have js turned off.

2015-12-02 13:37:25	mvaenskae	wiktor_b: i guess not on the common compiler optimisations that the paper discussed, including linearisation being unsound in the presence of atomic, roach motel reorderings or even strengthening of meory access types
2015-12-02 13:37:48	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: some things will be similar but it's very superficial
2015-12-02 13:38:05	mvaenskae	the c11 memory model they presented has a marvelous design bug imho
2015-12-02 13:38:10	+wiktor_b	classes, templates, virtual functions, ... change the story a lot
2015-12-02 13:39:44	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: which is?
2015-12-02 13:40:21	mvaenskae	two threads, single atomic stores/loads on each op and all vars are 0 in the beginning:  t0:[ if(x.load){ y.store(1); } ] t1:( if(y.load){ x.store(1); } ]
2015-12-02 13:41:06	mvaenskae	a theoretical execution would store 1 to x and y
2015-12-02 13:41:12	+wiktor_b	not
2015-12-02 13:41:19	+wiktor_b	it's undefined
2015-12-02 13:41:19	mvaenskae	http://plv.mpi-sws.org/c11comp/popl15.pdf

2015-12-02 13:41:55	+wiktor_b	actually I'd guess in reality both x and y would remain 0
2015-12-02 13:41:58	mvaenskae	that is not undefined, they are single atomic load/stores and those are not racy, thereby still defined
2015-12-02 13:42:36	+wiktor_b	how on earth would they ever become 1?
2015-12-02 13:42:39	mvaenskae	trust me, my professor and a TA were baffled as well with that
2015-12-02 13:43:12	+likewhoa	torindel: just ordered http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=14-150-731
2015-12-02 13:43:18	mvaenskae	the explanation is in the paper, the last paragraph in the firs coloumn on page 2 shows it
2015-12-02 13:44:20	mvaenskae	wiktor_b: i would guess researchers getting such a talk into POPL'15 should know what they talk about
2015-12-02 13:44:29	+wiktor_b	achhhh
2015-12-02 13:44:44	mvaenskae	the thing is, that execution is not executed in compilers though (for whatever reason)
2015-12-02 13:45:00	+wiktor_b	that's an interesting way to write the standard
2015-12-02 13:45:05	mvaenskae	so the model theoretically allows it but there are no concrete implementations followin that
2015-12-02 13:45:20	+wiktor_b	that's typical c, though
2015-12-02 13:45:34	+wiktor_b	standards and implementations are separate :)
2015-12-02 13:45:45	mvaenskae	you agree that the memory model is borked?
2015-12-02 13:45:53	+wiktor_b	no
2015-12-02 13:45:57	+wiktor_b	it makes sense
2015-12-02 13:46:04	+wiktor_b	it's unusual but it does make sense
2015-12-02 13:46:07	mvaenskae	why would that make sense?
2015-12-02 13:46:47	mvaenskae	how can the memory model allow assumptions to be made and only afterwards verify them?
2015-12-02 13:47:33	mvaenskae	i am asking because i am totally baffled and the explanations thus far that i could come up with are not sufficient to my mind
2015-12-02 13:48:15	+wiktor_b	that's what you often get with c
2015-12-02 13:48:24	+wiktor_b	the spec is written to enable implementations on diverse hardware
2015-12-02 13:48:49	+wiktor_b	basically it allows the compiler, scheduler, and hardware to reorder operations whatever way they want
2015-12-02 13:48:50	mvaenskae	please tell me then how an if-statement can be assumed to be correct and then only after executing it check it? :)
2015-12-02 13:49:10	+wiktor_b	which is the most portable way to spec it

2015-12-02 13:50:44	mvaenskae	speaking of the previous example? :)
2015-12-02 13:50:53	mvaenskae	LB that is
2015-12-02 13:50:53	+wiktor_b	but it does mean you can get r1 == r2 == 0
2015-12-02 13:51:01	+wiktor_b	you can also get 1 in either
2015-12-02 13:51:11	+wiktor_b	yes
2015-12-02 13:51:22	+wiktor_b	but the same idea applies in the second example
2015-12-02 13:51:47	mvaenskae	i am still wondering if that doesn't break the control flow intended by the programmer
2015-12-02 13:51:51	+wiktor_b	but a compiler is allowed to notice it and optimise it into two stores and no load
2015-12-02 13:52:09	mvaenskae	not with the relaxed semantics i think
2015-12-02 13:52:19	+wiktor_b	the opposite
2015-12-02 13:52:27	+wiktor_b	the relaxed semantics is exactly what allows it
2015-12-02 13:53:34	+wiktor_b	basically the compiler can notice that x could be 1 by the time the if is reached, so it's allowed to optimise it away into just y.store
2015-12-02 13:53:38	mvaenskae	i am uncertain, can it tell for certain that the loads always evaluate to a constant?
2015-12-02 13:53:53	+wiktor_b	and it can also, in a separate run, notice that y could be one and optimise the other if
2015-12-02 13:54:28	mvaenskae	but the reasoning they give allows at execution time the threads to speculate the loafs evaluate as true, do the stores and then check afterwards
2015-12-02 13:55:15	+wiktor_b	basically, the example is unspecified behaviour
2015-12-02 13:55:49	mvaenskae	c11 really seems in design very... liberal
2015-12-02 13:56:02	+wiktor_b	only the multithread stuff
2015-12-02 13:56:07	mvaenskae	btw, gcc-6.0 will enable c++14 as default iirc
2015-12-02 13:56:11	+wiktor_b	and this example seems quite artificial tbh
2015-12-02 13:56:38	mvaenskae	it is a very small example that has been used throughout the paper to show issues in the model
2015-12-02 13:56:52	+wiktor_b	and if you're trying to check a value that's set from another thread without any synchro, your design is sh*te :)
2015-12-02 13:57:14	mvaenskae	that is a point i thought about as well
2015-12-02 13:57:26	mvaenskae	still interesting behaviour
2015-12-02 13:58:10	mvaenskae	i forgot mentioning one issue during my presentation... that is that changing the atomic access mode will obviously introduce new semantics
2015-12-02 13:58:11	+wiktor_b	c allows you to shoot yourself in the foot
2015-12-02 13:58:21	+wiktor_b	in other news, water can be wet
2015-12-02 13:58:35	mvaenskae	if i want to sync stuff i would use the proper construct
2015-12-02 13:58:47	mvaenskae	and not have interleaving issuess
2015-12-02 13:58:49	Cheaterman	wiktor_b: that's why i like python
2015-12-02 13:58:52	Cheaterman	same spirit
2015-12-02 13:59:00	Cheaterman	makes you able to achieve great stuff
2015-12-02 13:59:30	+wiktor_b	this sort of construct (checking a value set by another thread) more or less requires synchro if you want it to work at all
2015-12-02 13:59:31	mvaenskae	wiktor_b: out of interest, how are you doing your musl work? meaning what tools do you use
2015-12-02 13:59:49	+wiktor_b	there are very few exceptions in which you'd want to omit synchro
2015-12-02 14:00:04	mvaenskae	introduce races! \o/
2015-12-02 14:00:08	+wiktor_b	vim, patch, diff, git, portage :)
2015-12-02 14:00:13	+wiktor_b	yup
2015-12-02 14:00:15	+wiktor_b	basically
2015-12-02 14:00:29	+wiktor_b	they showed a racy example and proved it can be racy
2015-12-02 14:01:04	+wiktor_b	and with c you really have to look at the context
2015-12-02 14:01:11	+wiktor_b	is it actually physically possible to run such code? no
2015-12-02 14:01:38	+wiktor_b	and this relaxation allows you to ignore the effects of various caches, memory delays, etc
2015-12-02 14:01:49	+wiktor_b	which makes implementations simpler and faster
2015-12-02 14:02:14	 *	mvaenskae is still kinda grumped up by having an out of order execution that should not be out of order

2015-12-02 14:05:26	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: basically, C is spec'd so that it runs on real hardware that exists
2015-12-02 14:05:42	Milo-	real hardware?
2015-12-02 14:05:49	Milo-	who uses those anymore
2015-12-02 14:05:50	Cheaterman	(and has a stack set up, right?! :P)
2015-12-02 14:05:59	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: other languages have much more abstract machine models, which allows you to do fancier semantics
2015-12-02 14:06:18	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: but that's only at the cost of speed
2015-12-02 14:06:36	+wiktor_b	Cheaterman: yes, you can't return from functions without a stack
2015-12-02 14:06:43	Cheaterman	with nowadays computing power it's much more maintainable and reliable to write code that's easy to read by humans
2015-12-02 14:06:47	Cheaterman	than easy to read by machines
2015-12-02 14:07:01	+wiktor_b	technically, with really dark linker magic, you should be able to convince a c program to run without a stack
2015-12-02 14:07:15	+wiktor_b	well, it will work until you try to call a function
2015-12-02 14:07:18	Cheaterman	like unwrapping the functions?
2015-12-02 14:07:29	+wiktor_b	but if your entire program is just a main() and doesn't call any functions, why not
2015-12-02 14:07:35	Cheaterman	if you try to hack functions out of macros
2015-12-02 14:07:38	Cheaterman	it should work
2015-12-02 14:07:49	+wiktor_b	but you cant use glibc
2015-12-02 14:07:54	Cheaterman	yeah ofc not
2015-12-02 14:08:05	 *	mvaenskae proposes a lot of goto
2015-12-02 14:08:09	Cheaterman	nor anything at all or nearly
2015-12-02 14:08:10	+wiktor_b	because glibc adds a stub at the beginning on your program that does some stuff then calls main()
2015-12-02 14:08:11	Cheaterman	hahaha mvaenskae
2015-12-02 14:08:23	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae++
2015-12-02 14:08:31	Cheaterman	wiktor_b: most libs need functions to work anyways
2015-12-02 14:08:32	mvaenskae	the interesting thing is, assembly is basically a lot of goto
2015-12-02 14:08:36	+wiktor_b	basically if you make your c program be more like a basic program, sure :D
2015-12-02 14:08:39	mvaenskae	with some conditions
2015-12-02 14:08:40	Cheaterman	mvaenskae: yep
2015-12-02 14:08:47	Cheaterman	jne, ja, je, etc
2015-12-02 14:09:12	Cheaterman	wiktor_b: that'd be funni
2015-12-02 14:09:13	+wiktor_b	but notice setting up a stack is very easy
2015-12-02 14:09:23	+wiktor_b	you just stick a pointer into a stack register and that's it
2015-12-02 14:09:26	Cheaterman	wiktor_b: you told me you worked on your bootloader for weeks and still do
2015-12-02 14:09:28	mvaenskae	wiktor_b: no, it's not trivial :(
2015-12-02 14:09:39	+wiktor_b	just make sure the stack is big enough
2015-12-02 14:09:41	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: what isnt?
2015-12-02 14:09:57	+wiktor_b	Cheaterman: it's quite nice now but still has loads of slimming to be done
2015-12-02 14:10:05	mvaenskae	i have to write a code generator and setting up a stack isn't trivial in an object-oriented language
2015-12-02 14:10:13	Cheaterman	which proves mvaenskae's point, it's definitely non-trivial
2015-12-02 14:10:22	+wiktor_b	setting up a stack is easy
2015-12-02 14:10:28	Cheaterman	mvaenskae: easier than in assembly
2015-12-02 14:10:31	+wiktor_b	making sure your stack is big enough requires some thought
2015-12-02 14:10:32	mvaenskae	especially setting up smart calling conventions
2015-12-02 14:10:45	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: that's different
2015-12-02 14:11:01	mvaenskae	i do admit even though it's a huge pita, i kinda love it
2015-12-02 14:11:03	+wiktor_b	and the calling covention should really be part of the abi
2015-12-02 14:11:21	mvaenskae	abi == ???
2015-12-02 14:11:26	mvaenskae	i cannot recall anymore :)
2015-12-02 14:11:28	+wiktor_b	unless you're writing a linker, you shouldn't care about stuff like this
2015-12-02 14:11:51	+wiktor_b	application binary interface
2015-12-02 14:12:13	Cheaterman	abliblibli
2015-12-02 14:12:14	Cheaterman	rather
2015-12-02 14:12:20	mvaenskae	no linking needed, but still allowing infinitly many classes to call themselves does require some thought process on casts and such
2015-12-02 14:12:49	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: you won't have infinite calling stuff without infinite memory :)
2015-12-02 14:12:50	mvaenskae	i am really very intrigueed by compilers and their workings
2015-12-02 14:13:08	Cheaterman	writing multitouch tangible applications with intuitive UX does require some thought process as well!
2015-12-02 14:13:24	Cheaterman	but at least it's funni
2015-12-02 14:13:26	mvaenskae	but i have to admit that i would need to start from scratch with the code to even understand the templates i am given sometimes
2015-12-02 14:13:37	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: write a simple os
2015-12-02 14:13:39	mvaenskae	wiktor_b: in theory it is allowed ;)

2015-12-02 14:15:03	+wiktor_b	seriously
2015-12-02 14:15:08	mvaenskae	that sounds like a lot of work
2015-12-02 14:15:09	+wiktor_b	write a simple bootloader and a basic kernel
2015-12-02 14:15:22	+wiktor_b	nah, it's actually quite easy once you wrap your head around it
2015-12-02 14:15:36	+wiktor_b	don't bother with advanced drivers and that, stick to BIOS calls
2015-12-02 14:16:01	mvaenskae	is efi loading a lot more difficult?
2015-12-02 14:16:16	+wiktor_b	just write a bootloader, a simple kernel stub, get it to set up an environment in which you can run c
2015-12-02 14:16:40	+wiktor_b	write some drivers in c and get it to do some simple task
2015-12-02 14:16:42	+wiktor_b	efi is cheating
2015-12-02 14:16:46	mvaenskae	stupid question, how would i boot that and verify it works?
2015-12-02 14:16:53	+wiktor_b	and so is multiboot
2015-12-02 14:17:14	+wiktor_b	use plain old bios because it doesn't set up a c environment for you
2015-12-02 14:17:18	+wiktor_b	efi and multiboot do

2015-12-02 15:07:01	+wiktor_b	the only tricky thing it setting up the stack is calculating how much stack you need
2015-12-02 15:07:14	+wiktor_b	e.g. on 32-bit x86, you need sh*tloads
2015-12-02 15:07:15	mvaenskae	i have already a symbol table given

2015-12-02 15:07:35	+wiktor_b	on 64-bin x86, you need less
2015-12-02 15:07:43	mvaenskae	i don't need to understand it and only 32bit so yeah
2015-12-02 15:07:51	+wiktor_b	on MIPS and most other RISCs, you need very little
2015-12-02 15:08:20	mvaenskae	if you mentioned the differences i would be glad to know them :)
2015-12-02 15:08:39	mvaenskae	x86 and x86_64 obviously has different calling conventions
2015-12-02 15:08:54	+wiktor_b	RISC arches tend to have loads of registers, so you pass your function parameters in registers
2015-12-02 15:09:24	mvaenskae	and under the assumption that there are many parameters? :)
2015-12-02 15:09:28	+wiktor_b	32-bit x86 has 4 general purpose registers
2015-12-02 15:09:30	mvaenskae	and local variables
2015-12-02 15:09:53	+wiktor_b	so on 32-bit x86 you pass parameters on the stack
2015-12-02 15:10:01	mvaenskae	how are esi/edi categorised? :)
2015-12-02 15:10:23	+wiktor_b	so a single function call requires loads of stack manipulation
2015-12-02 15:10:32	mvaenskae	i thought x86 had 6 GPRs but that could be a simplification
2015-12-02 15:10:33	+wiktor_b	which is one reason why 64-bit code is faster

2015-12-02 15:12:08	+wiktor_b	so the x86 calling convention says parameters go on the stack
2015-12-02 15:12:34	+wiktor_b	so you need loads of stack space in a memory-starved arch

2015-12-02 15:13:15	+wiktor_b	amd64 and the RISCs have calling conventions that say params go into registers, unless you have loads of params, then the extra params go on the stack
2015-12-02 15:13:24	+wiktor_b	which makes them fast and not use up so much memory
2015-12-02 15:13:39	+wiktor_b	i'm still not convinced amd64 binaries consume more memory
2015-12-02 15:14:00	mvaenskae	are the amd64 and risc calling conventions similiar in setup?
2015-12-02 15:14:28	+wiktor_b	they tend to be simple
2015-12-02 15:14:51	+wiktor_b	stick params into registers, push instruction pointer, jump
2015-12-02 15:15:16	+wiktor_b	then when you return, you pop and jump :)
2015-12-02 15:16:37	+wiktor_b	on arches that have stack instructions and allow you to specify where to pop, a return can be a single function, pop ip
2015-12-02 15:17:01	+wiktor_b	provided you don't need to jump to write to ip
2015-12-02 15:17:23	+wiktor_b	but i'm sure at least some versions of mips let you write to ip willy-nilly, but don't quote me on that
2015-12-02 15:18:03	+wiktor_b	but as you can see, on amd64 and risc there's little penalty for function calls and parameters
2015-12-02 15:18:15	+wiktor_b	because you only need to push/pop a single pointer
2015-12-02 15:18:32	+wiktor_b	on x86 you have to push a bunch of stuff and a pointer
2015-12-02 15:18:45	+wiktor_b	remember memory is slow
2015-12-02 15:18:49	mvaenskae	stupid question, but could one implement a new calling convention when designing a compiler that creates assembly code?
2015-12-02 15:18:59	+wiktor_b	x86 has a tiny memory space
2015-12-02 15:19:23	+wiktor_b	yes
2015-12-02 15:19:41	+wiktor_b	but then you're incompatible with everything else around :)
2015-12-02 15:19:57	mvaenskae	i am merely wondering :)
2015-12-02 15:20:13	mvaenskae	that would at least allow for interesting designs of programs/hardware
2015-12-02 15:20:29	+wiktor_b	you know the stupid thing about x86 is that you're pushing a bunch of stuff only to pop it right back out
2015-12-02 15:20:37	mvaenskae	if one knows certain properties about future programs one can obviously optimise for that

2015-12-02 16:27:00	shadowdao	Programming is the art of putting wrappers around wrappers.

2015-12-02 22:51:16	robink	Hello
2015-12-02 22:52:04	robink	CMEPTb, iamben: FYI, Adobe is killing Flash.
2015-12-02 22:52:05	robink	(sorta)
2015-12-02 22:53:28	robink	Adobe Flash CC is now called Adobe Animate CC, and they're steering people towards compiling down to minified-JS(+SVG(+SMIL))+Canvas(+WebGL)
2015-12-02 23:01:05	CMEPTb	what does steering people towward compiling mean? which people too?
2015-12-02 23:18:11	robink	CMEPTb: All Flash (.fla) animations are compiled to *something*.
2015-12-02 23:18:29	robink	CMEPTb: Adobe is now trying to steer people away from compiling to .swf (compiled Adobe Flash files).
2015-12-02 23:18:44	robink	CMEPTb: Instead, they are trying to get users of Adobe Animate (neé Flash) to compile their projects to JS+HTML5.
2015-12-02 23:19:01	robink	CMEPTb: The people they are trying to steer towards HTML5 are the users of Adobe Animate.
2015-12-02 23:19:09	robink	CMEPTb: I'm not entirely sure which portion of what I said is unclear.
2015-12-02 23:19:22	robink	CMEPTb: Subject, object, verb.
2015-12-02 23:20:27	+monk	morning
2015-12-02 23:21:11	+monk	i need to get apache to display a maintenance page via a script....any ideas?
2015-12-02 23:22:18	robink	monk: Erm, CGI script?  FastCGI?
2015-12-02 23:22:22	robink	monk: Does the thing stay resident?

2015-12-02 23:22:55	+monk	so the apache is basically forwarding requests to a weblogic server
2015-12-02 23:23:02	+monk	so im using virtualhosts
2015-12-02 23:23:04	robink	monk: Does the webserver literally exec the script, feed the headers into stdin, and then take stdout and serve it?
2015-12-02 23:23:11	jam3s2k3	oooh, just saw an internet thing and I've gotta test somma yall's intelligence
2015-12-02 23:23:23	robink	monk: I'm not worried about the internal setup of the webserver, I'm talking about how the webserver or whatever intermediate communicates with the script.
2015-12-02 23:23:47	jam3s2k3	What is a word made up of 4 letters, yet is made up of 3. Although is written with 8 letters, and then with 4. Rarely consists of 6, and never is written with 5.
2015-12-02 23:23:53	+monk	robink: the script will be manually executed when we need to display the down page
2015-12-02 23:24:00	robink	monk: OK, so standard old-school CGI.
2015-12-02 23:24:05	+monk	mkay
2015-12-02 23:24:15	robink	monk: and it literally says "The site/page is down"?
2015-12-02 23:24:30	robink	monk: ...and give some metadata about why the site/page might be down...?
2015-12-02 23:24:37	+eroen	moin o/
2015-12-02 23:24:40	robink	eroen: Moining.
2015-12-02 23:24:50	+eroen	:D
2015-12-02 23:25:03	+monk	robink: so i'll have another page to display instead of the weblogic forwarding
2015-12-02 23:25:06	+eroen	MooingLemur: *tug*
2015-12-02 23:25:12	robink	monk: I still think this would be better handled by something that could maintain state in between being called.

2015-12-02 23:25:28	robink	monk: OK, I might need to have a better sense of how this thing flows.
2015-12-02 23:25:36	+monk	ok one sec
2015-12-02 23:26:20	robink	monk: When the site is down (automatically determined conditions, or...?) you have the CGI script render on behalf of the user.  The CGI script does not (and does not need to) maintain any state between calls.
2015-12-02 23:26:43	jam3s2k1	eroen, allo
2015-12-02 23:27:02	robink	monk: and when the site is down, you never 302 to the "weblogic" backend.  Do you ever have the CGI script display when the a URL normally routed directly to "weblogic" (w/o redirect) is being requested?
2015-12-02 23:27:22	+monk	robink: http://pastebin.com/A86xSqRN  thats the wlrequest setup on httpd.conf

2015-12-02 23:27:55	robink	monk: OK, so how is the site determined to be "down"?
2015-12-02 23:28:11	+monk	when we take down weblogic
2015-12-02 23:28:14	robink	monk: Do you just want the boilerplate for a CGI-script handler?
2015-12-02 23:28:17	robink	monk: ...
2015-12-02 23:28:26	robink	monk: Does the Apache server *know* that the weblogic backend is down?
2015-12-02 23:28:29	+monk	so when we want to deploy changes
2015-12-02 23:28:33	robink	monk: Or do you have to "tell" it?
2015-12-02 23:28:39	jam3s2k1	on the flip side, though, I now undertsand ipv6 and have developed a disdain for ipv4

2015-12-02 23:29:13	+monk	robink: i'll be telling it
2015-12-02 23:29:38	robink	monk: So basically your "telling" it could just be setting up a wildcard route to a CGI-script-specific handler.
2015-12-02 23:29:52	+monk	so i need a script to tell apache to only display "this" page instead of doing its normal job of forwarding weblogic requests
2015-12-02 23:29:53	robink	monk: but I imagine you want to "tell" it with a minimum of configuration change.
2015-12-02 23:30:07	+monk	ideally
2015-12-02 23:30:12	robink	monk: and the page in question is not a static page, nor could it be represented by one.
2015-12-02 23:30:41	robink	monk: because you want to display some "live", side-effect-ful data when loading the "website is down" page.
2015-12-02 23:30:45	jesuisb	monk: you probably just want to wrap your config with <IfDefine somevar> sorry page site down stuff </IfDefine> <IfDefine !somevar> regular config </IfDefine> -- then you start apache with a -Dsomevar flag and the sorry page is displayed...there's probably lots of examples of that way out there
2015-12-02 23:31:12	+monk	hmmm
2015-12-02 23:31:17	+monk	let me think moar about it
2015-12-02 23:31:30	robink	jesuisb: If he wanted to decouple the "informing" of Apache from the logic that actually handles the alternate routes and loads the script/page/magic.
2015-12-02 23:32:07	robink	monk: Sort of what jesuisb said, but I'd write a custom handler and swap that in and out either directly or with the <IfDefine> block he suggested.
2015-12-02 23:32:29	robink	monk: It's also been yonks since I've used Apache; I'm a 100% nginx shop now.
2015-12-02 23:34:12	robink	monk: So you could combine the two and do something like <IfDefine TheSystemIsDown>SetHandler doodoodoodoodoo</IfDefine> for one of your global routes.

Well, because of the hole, she was also running the heater full-blast in the car, so it was pretty hot. Out of nowhere, the back window completely explodes in to a billion

2015-12-03 03:15:40	deathlire	well...
2015-12-03 03:16:13	deathlire	i'd recommend stating which fs your fs is using for each first.
2015-12-03 03:16:31	+doc235	why?
2015-12-03 03:16:37	+doc235	ext3 for the answer
2015-12-03 03:16:51	+lejonet	doc235: what user are you running rsync as? Because that is the user it'll try to ssh with to 192.168.1.5
2015-12-03 03:16:53	deathlire	and if your router is set up to know whats on those.
2015-12-03 03:17:04	deathlire	oyy why not ext4?
2015-12-03 03:17:06	+lejonet	and if with root, then root might not be allowed to login over ssh
2015-12-03 03:17:37	+doc235	lejonet. i tried as user doc235 and got file failures but as root i can't get past password
2015-12-03 03:17:49	deathlire	and if that's the case..use 'ssh -l username 192.168.1.5

2015-12-03 03:18:39	+wiktor_b	doc235: then you need to type in root@192.168.1.5 password
2015-12-03 03:18:41	deathlire	root over root..to another system isn't going to work..
2015-12-03 03:18:52	+wiktor_b	make sure root logins via ssh are allowed on 192.168.1.5
2015-12-03 03:18:55	+doc235	ok i am ssh'd into the computer 192.168.1.9 and want to copy all of /home/patty to 192.168.1.5/oldhome/home/patty :)
2015-12-03 03:19:38	+doc235	ok wiktor_b or lejonet how can i fix the root password? i recal something about it here but don't remember th e fix
2015-12-03 03:19:56	+lejonet	doc235: check in /etc/ssh/sshd_config if root login is allowed firstly

2015-12-03 03:25:50	deathlire	ok well i'll tell you..your comp is fighting over root..have different passes for both comps at least and it should solve that problem and also read 'man ssh' :_

2015-12-03 12:26:25	shingetsu	there probably are reasonable regulations (e.g if 99.5% of all crimes are comitted by casual criminals using registered weapons, maybe making registering that specific weapon makes sense, but no general "guns are bad, k?", because that just makes no sense)

2015-12-03 12:34:08	jam3s2001	bonsaikitten, that's because the people that own guns (yours truly) tend to horde them

2015-12-03 12:34:56	jam3s2001	bonsaikitten, also, there's a waiting period for handguns, fbi background checks prior to purchasing, several major factors that exclude most groups from owning them, AND the cost of the weapons is quite high

2015-12-03 12:43:04	shingetsu	I agree with Monkeh, and the solution is thus stronger gun license mental health regulations

2015-12-04 14:36:39	AwoL	I think that there is difficulty understanding that skinny != fit
2015-12-04 14:36:49	+Cheaterman	i'm the living proof of that
2015-12-04 14:36:52	+Cheaterman	:D
2015-12-04 14:37:09	AwoL	ha, I hear a lot of thinish girls saying that they want to look like <insert some random fitness model's name here> and not realize they have to gain 20 pounds to get there

2015-12-04 14:37:36	AwoL	lol
2015-12-04 14:37:53	+Cheaterman	girls who say they wanna look like a model usually aren't worth dating
2015-12-04 14:38:00	+Cheaterman	or frequenting at all for that matter
2015-12-04 14:38:29	+Cheaterman	I prefer looking like who I am ^__^
2015-12-04 14:38:43	puddlejumper	i like fit women that are well disciplined
2015-12-04 14:38:58	+Cheaterman	You could use a whip, makes all women disciplined
2015-12-04 14:39:11	puddlejumper	self-disciplined

2015-12-04 14:39:51	+Cheaterman	I'm not that sort of person, so I would find that sort of person quite boring I suppose
2015-12-04 14:40:10	+Cheaterman	Fortunately didn't get to meet many disciplined people :)
2015-12-04 14:40:17	puddlejumper	what's more rare? a woman making it through a 4 year degree in the humanities or a woman becoming a top model?
2015-12-04 14:40:30	puddlejumper	which requires more work and self-discipline
2015-12-04 14:40:30	+Cheaterman	humanities?
2015-12-04 14:41:09	+Cheaterman	what do you mean humanities
2015-12-04 14:41:36	puddlejumper	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities
2015-12-04 14:42:15	+Cheaterman	Sounds boring
2015-12-04 14:42:17	puddlejumper	most women educated women specialize in a field of humanities

2015-12-04 14:43:36	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: most women in academia
2015-12-04 14:43:42	+Cheaterman	Okay
2015-12-04 14:44:11	+Cheaterman	I've seen quite a few become nurses, artists and businesswomen though
2015-12-04 14:44:26	+Cheaterman	and by seen I mean censored of course
2015-12-04 14:44:50	puddlejumper	art is humanities
2015-12-04 14:44:57	+Cheaterman	what about finance
2015-12-04 14:45:01	+Milo-	business
2015-12-04 14:45:04	+Cheaterman	owiii

2015-12-04 14:45:26	+Cheaterman	okay
2015-12-04 14:45:32	+Cheaterman	so everything falls into these three categories?
2015-12-04 14:45:50	puddlejumper	there's a few more
2015-12-04 14:45:51	+Cheaterman	getting drunk all week without doing anything, which category
2015-12-04 14:46:07	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: that's a sub-category
2015-12-04 14:46:12	+Cheaterman	hahahaha
2015-12-04 14:46:33	+Milo-	I think getting drunk falls under humanities
2015-12-04 14:46:37	+Cheaterman	I don't like putting people into labeled drawers like that :)
2015-12-04 14:46:43	puddlejumper	i'm living proof that you can make a good living while drinking everyday

2015-12-04 14:47:55	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: just because you say someone studies or studied humanities doesn't mean that's all there is to know about them o.0

2015-12-04 15:06:48	puddlejumper	opening at the top really
2015-12-04 15:07:05	+Cheaterman	puddlejumper: although if you indeed had waves and aeration, it would be enough, it just happens that the bubbler does the job
2015-12-04 15:07:24	+Cheaterman	and it's easier to put in place than a wave generator in an aquarium really

2015-12-04 15:07:40	+Cheaterman	sufficient surface water movement would be enough to draw oxygen back in, yes
2015-12-04 15:07:59	+Cheaterman	or do you think we put air pumps below oceans to help fish stay alive
2015-12-04 15:08:07	+Cheaterman	just because we can, you know

2015-12-04 15:09:17	+Cheaterman	but really the bubbler not only moves the water but also replenishes oxygen in a volume not only from the top area
2015-12-04 15:09:24	+Cheaterman	puddlejumper: 2°) for me, usually
2015-12-04 15:09:36	+Cheaterman	or most often 3) because I read it
2015-12-04 15:09:39	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: yeah it makes sense
2015-12-04 15:10:04	+Cheaterman	puddlejumper: also
2015-12-04 15:10:10	+Cheaterman	experiment: how to remove oxygen from water
2015-12-04 15:10:15	+Cheaterman	bring it close to boiling
2015-12-04 15:10:24	+Cheaterman	you'll see smaller bubbles, these are the dissolved gas, going back to gas form
2015-12-04 15:10:29	+Cheaterman	because water can't hold them anymore
2015-12-04 15:10:48	+Cheaterman	bigger bubbles will be steam, and they'll go up rather fast, while smaller bubbles stick to the botto mof the pan
2015-12-04 15:11:12	+Cheaterman	usually you'll see smaller bubbles much before bigger bubbles, and you'll stop being smaller ones as soon as you see the bigger ones
2015-12-04 15:11:31	puddlejumper	yeah
2015-12-04 15:11:33	+Cheaterman	because by the time your water reaches boiling temperature, assuming it's relatively pure, all of its dissolved gas will be gone
2015-12-04 15:11:52	+Cheaterman	so, that basically shows that dissolved gas aren't bubbles, unless they're not dissolved anymore
2015-12-04 15:11:53	puddlejumper	because there's not chemical reaction they can be separated i'm guessing
2015-12-04 15:12:02	puddlejumper	like i said chemistry isn't my thing
2015-12-04 15:12:23	+Cheaterman	it's not really my thing either ^^" what I'm saying is approximations
2015-12-04 15:12:53	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: if it was bubbles it would float to the top and go away and it would be pointless
2015-12-04 15:13:02	+Cheaterman	well my dad happens to be some sort of cooking engineer, so he taught me a lot about such things
2015-12-04 15:13:11	+Cheaterman	puddlejumper: you got it buddy
2015-12-04 15:13:16	+Cheaterman	so fishes don't want bubbles :)

2015-12-04 15:14:25	+Cheaterman	you were correct
2015-12-04 15:14:38	puddlejumper	for the wrong reason :p
2015-12-04 15:14:48	+Cheaterman	it's just that it's not so much the bubbles, but rather the fact that they're microscopically smaller at the top of the tank than they were when emitted from the pump
2015-12-04 15:15:05	+Cheaterman	because a small amount of them was dissolved into the water :)
2015-12-04 15:15:32	puddlejumper	this must also be why water from a facet makes one more bloated :/

2015-12-04 15:17:21	+Cheaterman	the only water that makes you bloated is gaseous one, like san pellegrino or perrier
2015-12-04 15:17:27	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: if you have water with a faucet that has a strainer or whatever it creates for bubbles in the water
2015-12-04 15:17:35	+Cheaterman	carbonated water*

2015-12-04 15:17:57	+Cheaterman	replenishes gas content in water for better taste
2015-12-04 15:18:06	puddlejumper	yeah
2015-12-04 15:18:09	+Cheaterman	puddlejumper: good experiment: boil water, cool it, drink it
2015-12-04 15:18:15	+Cheaterman	it'll not taste like water
2015-12-04 15:18:21	+Cheaterman	because the dissolved gas has taste
2015-12-04 15:18:39	+Cheaterman	the sprinkler thingy helps replenishing gas content for that reason
2015-12-04 15:18:40	puddlejumper	Cheaterman: i think that is why most coffee shops have one of those machines for oxygening water
2015-12-04 15:18:50	+Cheaterman	would make sense yes
2015-12-04 15:19:10	+Cheaterman	although are you not talking about the steam heater?

2015-12-05 07:18:25	+Cheaterman	what course?
2015-12-05 07:18:48	mvaenskae	to get a better grade in the exam each student has to submit an "exam-level" question that will increase the grade by .25
2015-12-05 07:19:23	mvaenskae	which is quite nice; and if one has the master solution to it one will also receive the extra credits the question is worth on the exam
2015-12-05 07:19:30	mvaenskae	Cheaterman: distributed computing
2015-12-05 07:20:24	+Cheaterman	Cool topic :D
2015-12-05 07:21:13	mvaenskae	we had software-defined networking as the last topic and i am wondering if that could serve as a good basis for a question
2015-12-05 07:21:16	mvaenskae	or bitcoin
2015-12-05 07:21:47	+Cheaterman	or SETI
2015-12-05 07:21:53	mvaenskae	SETI?
2015-12-05 07:22:00	+Cheaterman	search for extra terrestrial intelligence
2015-12-05 07:22:07	+Cheaterman	iirc they have a crowd computing app?
2015-12-05 07:22:13	mvaenskae	i cannot use topics we didn't discuss ;)
2015-12-05 07:22:16	+Cheaterman	ah ^^"
2015-12-05 07:23:35	mvaenskae	i would guess combining byzantine nodes and those two networks might lead to a good question but i don't know how SDN fully works in the application domain
2015-12-05 07:31:52	mvaenskae	hm, i think i was recommended SDN in here as a topic to read up on earlier already, not sure though :(

2015-12-05 09:08:14	mvaenskae	hm, anyone here experience with how bitcoins are actually generated? from what i see there are no real coins but merely transaction records
2015-12-05 09:10:12	mvaenskae	also an interesting concept, something digital being worth something irl
2015-12-05 09:10:33	+hosler	like proprietary software
2015-12-05 09:12:42	mvaenskae	not the same i feel; bitcoins are not software duing something ;) just some public-private keys from the looks
2015-12-05 09:12:44	+jesuisb	no no, he said "worth something"
2015-12-05 09:13:54	mvaenskae	and proprietary software actually, even if expensive does something in our world except being something of a "valuable" concept that might crash tomorrow
2015-12-05 09:14:07	+hosler	wut
2015-12-05 09:14:11	mvaenskae	crash in terms of value
2015-12-05 09:14:36	mvaenskae	if noone were to use bitcoins anymore starting tomorrow they aren't worth anything anymore
2015-12-05 09:14:58	+hosler	same with any government currency
2015-12-05 09:15:16	+jesuisb	same with gold. same with sea shells.
2015-12-05 09:15:18	gizmore	mvaenskae: bitcoins are generated as reward for computing transactions
2015-12-05 09:15:26	mvaenskae	true, but there is usually a higher guarantee for it to not go into nothingness tomorrow ;)
2015-12-05 09:15:47	mvaenskae	sally sells sea shells, by the sea shore
2015-12-05 09:15:58	+jesuisb	see? they *are* valuable@
2015-12-05 09:16:06	+jesuisb	:P
2015-12-05 09:16:32	mvaenskae	but still, i would never compare bitcoins to software
2015-12-05 09:16:41	gizmore	mvaenskae: for a transaction to be valid, a hash has to be computed which starts with some amount of '0', like md5(transaction+youranswer),begins_with?('0000000') ... the network all calculates the solution to finally sign a transaction, and the correct solution is rewarded with bitcoins
2015-12-05 09:17:31	mvaenskae	gizmore: so there is some sort of brute force problem someone has to calculate and that is usually quite hard whereas the verification is simple?
2015-12-05 09:17:46	gizmore	mvaenskae: correct
2015-12-05 09:17:52	mvaenskae	could there exist collisions where another solution could be possible?
2015-12-05 09:18:15	gizmore	as it´s a hash, there are unlimited solutions
2015-12-05 09:18:35	mvaenskae	i thought some hashes are collision free
2015-12-05 09:19:22	gizmore	if the hash is of fixed size... it is not possible :)
2015-12-05 09:19:30	AsumFace	how can a hash be collision free when the output has a fixes amount of digits
2015-12-05 09:19:35	+jesuisb	that's not logically possible. you can't encode infinity in the size of a hash
2015-12-05 09:20:17	mvaenskae	alright, i did stay in the realm of current computing technology :)
2015-12-05 09:20:48	mvaenskae	my bad and true, for an infinite input that is not a bijective function
2015-12-05 09:21:31	+doc235	what is redacting?
2015-12-05 09:21:49	+jesuisb	it is when you [redacted], some people think it's [redacted], i tend to say [redacted]
2015-12-05 09:21:58	+jesuisb	:)
2015-12-05 09:22:06	+jesuisb	masked off, filtered out, taken away
2015-12-05 09:22:08	+doc235	:/
2015-12-05 09:22:15	+doc235	ahh ok, ty
2015-12-05 09:23:16	mvaenskae	gizmore: so if someone were to take over the bitcoin network one theoretically needs to be able to find a flaw that allows much quicker computations of those hashes than what is the current standard, right?
2015-12-05 09:24:06	gizmore	it also is enough to control 50% of bitcoin clients, and deny all valid solutions
2015-12-05 09:24:08	+jesuisb	or just control more than half the network, then you can always get "agreement" that what you've got is right
2015-12-05 09:24:22	mvaenskae	deny solutions?
2015-12-05 09:24:37	gizmore	agree or deny solutions others have computed
2015-12-05 09:25:49	mvaenskae	so one could include a whole bunch of bots inside the network that allow answers within one another disregarding validity but discard any answers from outside?

2015-12-05 10:13:02	+doc235	yup
2015-12-05 10:13:05	+Cheaterman	That's not uncommon
2015-12-05 10:13:24	+Cheaterman	do you use hplip driver/utility?
2015-12-05 10:13:29	+doc235	no
2015-12-05 10:13:35	+Cheaterman	maybe you should give it a try
2015-12-05 10:13:50	+doc235	i did, did not find it either :)

2015-12-05 10:13:53	+Cheaterman	Okay
2015-12-05 10:14:11	+Cheaterman	Did you try to take a look at ArchLinux's hplip wiki page
2015-12-05 10:14:31	+doc235	yup
2015-12-05 10:14:56	+Cheaterman	iirc they might descirbe a caveat about scanners
2015-12-05 10:15:10	+doc235	i don't recall
2015-12-05 10:15:30	+doc235	i think it is that none are setup to locate a wireless printer
2015-12-05 10:15:40	+doc235	it sits on a file cabinet by itself
2015-12-05 10:15:48	+Cheaterman	hmm, hplip can locate pretty much anything in principle
2015-12-05 10:16:02	+Cheaterman	it's made for USB/network printers alike
2015-12-05 10:16:26	+doc235	emergeing it now anyway :)
2015-12-05 10:16:34	+Cheaterman	silly questions but did you try setting it up through USB first
2015-12-05 10:16:43	+Cheaterman	might need some udev rules, kernel config options etc, but should work easily
2015-12-05 10:16:54	+Cheaterman	once you're sure this works, you could start working on the network scanning part

2015-12-05 23:47:09	_anomaly_	not entirely sure, guess it depends on the permissions on /var/lib/asound.state ot wherever the file lives

2015-12-05 23:53:52	arvut	I wonder why it suddenly stopped enabling it by default though.. maybe a update that messed with configs
2015-12-05 23:54:20	arvut	those ssh updates drive me mad, now I can't talk to my router cuz the algokex is too old
2015-12-05 23:54:37	arvut	diffie-hellman is obsolete -.-
2015-12-05 23:55:13	dwfreed	it's not diffie-hellman
2015-12-05 23:55:15	dwfreed	it's DSA
2015-12-05 23:55:54	arvut	so how do I talk to it?
2015-12-05 23:56:26	_anomaly_	telnet
2015-12-05 23:56:33	arvut	no, I don't
2015-12-05 23:56:34	_anomaly_	so insecure no one would think to look for it
2015-12-05 23:57:00	dwfreed	If you are stuck with DSA keys, you can re-enable support locally by
2015-12-05 23:57:00	dwfreed	updating your sshd_config and ~/.ssh/config files with lines like so:
2015-12-05 23:57:01	dwfreed	        PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dss
2015-12-05 23:57:02	arvut	might be time to reflash it, I think there is a firmware by openwrt for it
2015-12-05 23:57:17	arvut	dss?
2015-12-05 23:57:28	dwfreed	dss is another name for DSA
2015-12-05 23:57:32	arvut	you mean +ssh-dsa?
2015-12-05 23:57:36	dwfreed	no
2015-12-05 23:57:37	arvut	right
2015-12-05 23:57:43	arvut	lets give it a go
2015-12-05 23:57:44	+jrunyon	also, ssh dropped support for a certificate format
2015-12-05 23:57:57	dwfreed	I copy-pasted that from the news item put out when 7.0 was released
2015-12-05 23:58:10	dwfreed	jrunyon: very few people use SSH certificates
2015-12-05 23:58:38	arvut	oh yeah, I have news to read
2015-12-05 23:58:43	+jrunyon	said format is still the default as of the latest ssh version in debian squeeze.
2015-12-05 23:58:44	arvut	I still forget to read those
2015-12-05 23:58:59	+jrunyon	i believe also wheezy.
2015-12-05 23:59:25	+jrunyon	dwfreed: true, but nevertheless
2015-12-05 23:59:57	+jrunyon	they completely removed it. with no deprecation notices (except one in the changelog after removing it without any description of how to tell if yours uses it.)
2015-12-06 00:00:12	+jrunyon	now authentication with a signed key merely says "unable to load key"
2015-12-06 00:00:42	+jrunyon	and no option to re-enable it, so far as i can tell.
2015-12-06 00:00:44	arvut	its probably a decent approach, but I do prefer insecure ssh over telnet
2015-12-06 00:02:40	dwfreed	jrunyon: um, they announced the new format in 5.6, and gave a deprecation notice of the old format at that time
2015-12-06 00:02:49	dwfreed	http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.6
2015-12-06 00:03:11	+jrunyon	dwfreed: ah, really? TIL
2015-12-06 00:03:50	+jrunyon	nevertheless, there shouldve been big warnings every time it was used.
2015-12-06 00:04:17	+jrunyon	not in a changelog that no one ever sees (because lets face it, who installs openssh outside of their distro's package manager)

2015-12-06 00:47:37	arvut	yeah, but the report system works, players get banned on a daily basis by really hardworking GM's that really believe in it. however its easy for players to circumvent it
2015-12-06 00:48:05	arvut	they even use the term "throwaway accounts" when you contact support to appeal a ban
2015-12-06 00:48:22	+Cheaterman	OTOH, LoL's report system leads to player-managed moderation, which works slightly less, but can handle much more users, and therefore is much harder to circumvent
2015-12-06 00:48:45	arvut	are there moderating done ingame or afterwards?
2015-12-06 00:48:54	+Cheaterman	Afterwards, of course, by neutral people who didn't participate
2015-12-06 00:49:02	arvut	cause that's as I see it, the biggest problem with MOBA games
2015-12-06 00:49:23	+Cheaterman	Game is recorded, and bad attitude can leave a stain on your account
2015-12-06 00:49:45	arvut	well, admins should be there when it happens, else the problem usually escalates and at the end you might end up with 5 reports instead of just the one that triggered it all
2015-12-06 00:49:55	+Cheaterman	There are no "admins"

2015-12-06 07:47:36	+Cheaterman	mvaenskae: Not exactly, the issue is more about having quick response to events on one hand, and making the output visually pleasant is more important than it being physically accurate
2015-12-06 07:47:40	+Cheaterman	If speaking about games
2015-12-06 07:47:58	+wiktor_b	mvaenskae: :-)
2015-12-06 07:48:27	+mvaenskae	meh, visually pleasant outputs have lens flares and shaky cam if going by movies ;)
2015-12-06 07:48:32	+mvaenskae	ohhhh and explosions!
2015-12-06 07:48:37	+mvaenskae	lots of explosions
2015-12-06 07:49:32	+Cheaterman	So the tradeoff is between speed of simulation which costs resources but increases accuracy, and trying your best to synchronize people with different clocks sending you events refering to different time steps at the same time
2015-12-06 07:49:42	+Cheaterman	it's a very hard topic

2015-12-06 07:51:54	+Cheaterman	you'd start movement on client side while sending the message, for prediction, and then the server will send you back the correct positions, it's now a matter of how you blend them in and correct your physics simulation accordingly
2015-12-06 07:52:26	+Cheaterman	ie smoothly synchronizing parallel non-deterministic physics simulations
2015-12-06 07:52:42	+mvaenskae	that sounds a lot more difficult than what we have handled :)

2015-12-06 07:53:31	+mvaenskae	someone needs to research it and then it has to become the defacto standard for multiplayer games!!!
2015-12-06 07:53:54	+Cheaterman	there are easy approaches to this, I'm just jumping straight to some evolved solutions that we've been using nowadays after years of evolution in games netcode
2015-12-06 07:54:14	+Cheaterman	Oh it is already the defacto standard
2015-12-06 07:54:20	+Cheaterman	has been for the past, say, 20 years
2015-12-06 07:54:30	+mvaenskae	still i see too many lagging issues in games
2015-12-06 07:54:43	+Cheaterman	Courtesy of Mr Carmack and Quake2's awesome and yet unmatched netcode
2015-12-06 07:55:02	+Cheaterman	You may not play the right ones
2015-12-06 07:55:37	+Cheaterman	Games using engines that are basically neither based on Quake2 nor developed by absolute experts in netcode are unfortunately more common these days
2015-12-06 07:56:15	+mvaenskae	but thanks for mentioning parallel; i think that is something i haven't yet thought about
2015-12-06 07:56:18	+Cheaterman	But Quake3, Half Life (and therefore Counter Strike), and all good competitive FPSs of that time were based on Q2's engine
2015-12-06 07:56:37	+Cheaterman	Just there was barely any physics on the client side back then, now we have ragdolls and stuff

2015-12-08 15:01:32	arvut	would make sense
2015-12-08 15:02:00	+Monkeh	If you're running time, you're not using the alias.

2015-12-08 15:02:21	arvut	finding invidiual time's from paralell exec commands makes more sense

2015-12-08 18:44:44	HedgeMage	Some people suck up systemd...generally, I advise that only when the user is unskilled enough that the DE guification/integration is likely to make them maintain their system better than switching to a wm.

2015-12-28 17:18:30	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: a distribution is defined by 3 things. 1. its package manager (slackware uses pkgtool, mandrake uses rpmdrake (RPM format), gentoo uses portage (ebuild format)). 2. its defaults (slackware is a bit similar to gentoo here, mandrake is closer to other more popular ones). 3. Approach to updates (slackware is weird, mandrake is dead, gentoo has different keywords and is constantly updated)
2015-12-28 17:18:43	hosler	he said gentoo is slackware or mandrake
2015-12-28 17:18:58	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: hopefully that helps clear it up. In short, Gentoo has nothing in common with slackware or mandrake except some approaches towards defaults being a bit similar to slackware.

2015-12-28 17:32:15	FuZi0N	SpaceToast: for example?
2015-12-28 17:32:24	+zlg	SpaceToast: Because the CA model is broken.
2015-12-28 17:32:36	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: on a proper gentoo setup, everything is very cleanly interconnected, with no fluff around the edges. This is thanks to the USE flag mechanics that portage (and derivatives) uses
2015-12-28 17:32:41	+zlg	It's centralized and largely controlled by corporations.
2015-12-28 17:32:50	eroen	zlg: irc/sasl has no ca :P
2015-12-28 17:33:06	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: ubuntu has one very specific use case in mind, and wanting anything outside of that is borderline impossible to set up (even things inside of that can get messy!)
2015-12-28 17:33:08	+zlg	GPG has keyservers, but no single keyserver is more important than another, and they aren't really required.
2015-12-28 17:33:25	+zlg	eroen: Self-signed?
2015-12-28 17:33:27	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: moreover, Gentoo allows you to get newer releases of packages faster, since there is no release system as in most binary distributions
2015-12-28 17:33:39	+zlg	SpaceToast: In theory*
2015-12-28 17:33:54	+zlg	Not all packages will get updated in a timely manner as it depends on how much time the maintainer has :P
2015-12-28 17:34:04	+zlg	I know I was a bit late in updating apulse.
2015-12-28 17:34:07	+zlg	By a few days.
2015-12-28 17:34:13	SpaceToast	yes zlg, but typically still faster than the 6 months you gotta wait on *buntu :P
2015-12-28 17:34:18	+zlg	oh, haha.
2015-12-28 17:34:22	+zlg	Yeah, far faster than that.
2015-12-28 17:34:29	SpaceToast	that was my point, lol
2015-12-28 17:34:36	FuZi0N	SpaceToast: but what about in terms of security?
2015-12-28 17:34:36	+zlg	But I thought package updates still happen on an Ubuntu release...
2015-12-28 17:34:40	+tamiko	zlg: Well, at least a fourth of the gentoo repository is a bit unmaintained as well.
2015-12-28 17:34:49	+zlg	tamiko: Wow is it that bad?
2015-12-28 17:35:08	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: finally, since Gentoo effectively forces (outside of public binhosts) you to compile everything, packages will tend to run faster, since they can be optimized more closely for your specific hardware, rather than try and be working in as many places as possible
2015-12-28 17:35:09	+zlg	I've honestly never figured out how to do meta analysis on the tree.
2015-12-28 17:35:15	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: in terms of security there are two parts to it
2015-12-28 17:35:40	+FrostFeline	Monkeh: Not sure what you mean by that. That gigabit nic by TP-Link does have gigabit performance.
2015-12-28 17:35:43	+zlg	I'm sure find, grep, and wc would get me far.
2015-12-28 17:36:03	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: first of all, toolchain hardening is a thing (in fact, there are packages that allow you to use a hardened toolchain and harden everything possible by defailt), which means that many vulnerabilities will be caught at compile time or similar
2015-12-28 17:36:12	SpaceToast	(though, as your friend pointed out, this isn't TERRIBLY important)
2015-12-28 17:36:14	+tamiko	zlg: Well, don't trust random numbers ;-)
2015-12-28 17:36:38	+zlg	Like 14? :P
2015-12-28 17:36:38	+tamiko	zlg: Luckily, the part of the tree that is unmaintained tends to highly coincide with dead upstream anyway.
2015-12-28 17:36:41	@Monkeh	FrostFeline: That very much depends on what you put through it and how well it likes the cabling. Plus, y'know, offload functionality is nice, Realtek aren't good at that.
2015-12-28 17:36:53	+zlg	tamiko: That's at least somewhat of a relief.
2015-12-28 17:36:57	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: secondly, Gentoo has a very good track record of applying security related patches very quickly, as well as backporting them. This is much easier for Gentoo systems to do, since there is no lengthy process of remaking packages and updating binary repos involved, and rather a simple bump in an ebuild with a new patch file.
2015-12-28 17:37:08	+zlg	SpaceToast: ++
2015-12-28 17:37:08	+FrostFeline	Monkeh: Are you talking about TCP checksum offload?
2015-12-28 17:37:22	@Monkeh	FrostFeline: There's a lot of other things you can offload..
2015-12-28 17:37:48	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: it is important to note, that a vast majority of actual security issues tend to happen due to USER error, rather than security issues in software. Though if the latter is what you're worried about, Gentoo is one of the best choices.

2015-12-28 17:38:48	eroen	no, bernalex is wizard
2015-12-28 17:38:48	SpaceToast	FuZi0N: the primary DOWNSIDE to Gentoo is that it does have a learning curve (since you need to learn how to properly use all that extra flexibility it gives you), as well as installing larger packages (e.g firefox) takes far longer, since you must compile them (note: compiling smaller packages from source can sometimes be faster than downloading the binaries for them, under some circumstances!)
2015-12-28 17:38:59	+FrostFeline	Monkeh: Oh
2015-12-28 17:39:00	+zlg	I've used a handful of distros and I have to say the Gentoo community's been the best imo.
2015-12-28 17:39:11	hosler	i can install gentoo in 20 minutes
2015-12-28 17:39:18	+FrostFeline	Monkeh: And what about the TP-Link routers?
2015-12-28 17:39:20	+zlg	I never felt like I was welcome or encouraged to contribute with Ubuntu, Debian, or Arch.
2015-12-28 17:39:29	eroen	hosler: I have a script that does it in 1
2015-12-28 17:39:33	SpaceToast	anyway, FuZi0N, hopefully you can easily tell that 1. "nobody uses it" is outright false; and 2. if that argument mattered, it would apply to linux in general, making the very argument outright silly
2015-12-28 17:39:35	hosler	no way
2015-12-28 17:39:38	@Monkeh	FrostFeline: They're slow MIPS things
2015-12-28 17:39:57	+zlg	eroen: It takes over a minute to bootstrap stage3 and sync :P
2015-12-28 17:39:58	+tamiko	hosler: What? Takes you that long? I do a $ c-clone amd64 and I have a fresh install (in a VM). Almost instantaneous :-P
2015-12-28 17:39:59	SpaceToast	zlg: with Arch it's a bit better (the AUR is fairly inviting), but it's not "proper" contributing. Ubuntu and Debian? forget about htat

2015-12-28 17:40:16	+FrostFeline	Monkeh: Slow in what sense? I get full gigabit out of my TP-Link gear.
2015-12-28 17:40:18	hosler	tamiko: you must use cheat codes
2015-12-28 17:40:46	hosler	eroen: do i see genkernel
2015-12-28 17:40:47	+FrostFeline	Monkeh: The only limitation is you can get gigabit over a VPN if you use the TP-Link as the concentrator.
2015-12-28 17:40:50	+zlg	SpaceToast: Yeah. Couple the poor quality of AUR's PKGBUILDs and how elitist the community became (especially after Judd's retirement from the project) and you have what's left of a distro that held great promise.
2015-12-28 17:40:56	+zlg	At least their wiki's pretty good.
2015-12-28 17:41:03	@Monkeh	FrostFeline: Full gigabit doing.. what?
2015-12-28 17:41:04	SpaceToast	agreed zlg :)
2015-12-28 17:41:11	+zlg	I can't be too harsh on Arch, though; they drove me to come here :)
2015-12-28 17:41:13	@Monkeh	FrostFeline: As a dumb switch I would expect nothing else..
2015-12-28 17:41:16	SpaceToast	exactly :)
2015-12-28 17:41:21	+tamiko	hosler: Well, $ btrfs clone [...] and a sketchy script that copies the container configuration.
2015-12-28 17:41:31	hosler	yeah thats cheating
2015-12-28 17:41:38	+zlg	I wouldn't have learned as much about Linux if it wasn't for Gentoo.
2015-12-28 17:41:40	+FrostFeline	Monkeh: routing packets of course,
2015-12-28 17:41:49	+zlg	my first self-compiled, self-configured kernel was on Gentoo
2015-12-28 17:41:50	eroen	hosler: not quite, it relies on a pre-built kernel and initramfs
2015-12-28 17:42:08	@Monkeh	FrostFeline: I very much doubt it can route at 1Gbps with any sort of complexity in the rules.
2015-12-28 17:42:11	hosler	eroen: my 20 minutes includes custom kernel build
2015-12-28 17:42:13	+zlg	Speaking of VMs...
2015-12-28 17:42:15	+tamiko	My whole LInux experience was and is on Gentoo.
2015-12-28 17:42:38	+tamiko	Somehow boring :-/
2015-12-28 17:42:49	+zlg	hosler: Any suggestions on how to best work with a VPS? I want to build packages on an identical VM and then make those packages available to the remote VPS. Is that a good model?
2015-12-28 17:42:52	+FrostFeline	Monkeh: Well the device only has 2 interfaces, usually. The rules can't be that complex in the first place.
2015-12-28 17:42:54	Viperlin	try others, you'll cry
2015-12-28 17:42:56	+zlg	I used to use a chroot but it had some odd behaviors.
2015-12-28 17:42:59	@Monkeh	Sure they can
2015-12-28 17:43:05	hosler	zlg: just build on vps
2015-12-28 17:43:17	hosler	no reason not to
2015-12-28 17:43:21	+zlg	Time?
2015-12-28 17:43:22	+FrostFeline	Monkeh: Unless you use the swconfig to split the switch.
2015-12-28 17:43:32	+zlg	I guess I could set the number of jobs to a lower value..
2015-12-28 17:43:43	hosler	i have several gentoo vps

2015-12-28 18:19:41	+FrostFeline	I'm sure power beaming firmware could be designed to be read only and only allow beaming to unobstructed devices that have the proper signalling in place.
