2015-11-08 01:43:45	Q	well, you say Debian upsets new users least. Migrated users come with the expectation of using their software, like Steam or Skype, not from a standpoint of idealism of running free software. Saying "well, you google about installing your Nvidia drivers" will certainly upset quite a few users, I can guarantee you.
2015-11-08 01:43:47	happygnu	When I search for patches for a program where do I find them ?

2015-11-08 02:08:59	happygnu	well I mean :)
2015-11-08 02:09:31	happygnu	good
2015-11-08 02:11:00	Korekame	happygnu, not that I'm aware of...
2015-11-08 02:11:19	Korekame	the machine I'm putting BSD on really wouldn't be good for steam even if it did work
2015-11-08 02:12:05	happygnu	so no Iris Pro, Nvidia
2015-11-08 02:12:16	happygnu	or Ati/AMD
2015-11-08 02:12:52	Korekame	I don't know, but none of that is necessary for my purposes, so I haven't really looked into it.
2015-11-08 02:13:49	happygnu	maybe you will need to use youtube-dl as youtube may stutter in the browser
2015-11-08 02:14:26	happygnu	youtube requires a lot of cpu to be smooth
2015-11-08 02:14:38	Korekame	nah, it's powerful enough for youtube, even if it's not really a concern as the only purpose this laptop will have is to sit in the rack to serve as a vnc/ssh console for my servers
2015-11-08 02:14:49	happygnu	...are you just going to use cli ?
2015-11-08 02:15:24	Korekame	no, it'll have a gui so I can do on the spot research if I run into issues with google or something in firefox
2015-11-08 02:15:28	happygnu	x11vnc can log on existing open display 0 ;)
2015-11-08 02:15:43	happygnu	not another x session required
2015-11-08 02:16:24	Korekame	yes, true, but, the way I have the firewall configured, these protocols will only be accessable from the internal network. My other computers are on a different network and I'm not bridging them across for security reasons.
2015-11-08 02:16:46	Korekame	separation of networks is good
2015-11-08 02:17:02	happygnu	I do like so:
2015-11-08 02:17:08	happygnu	ssh -t -L 5900:localhost:5900 root@IPTARGET 'x11vnc -forever -localhost -display :0 -ultrafilexfer -auth /home/pi/.Xauthority'
2015-11-08 02:17:21	happygnu	xtightvncviewer -encodings "copyrect tight hextile" -quality 5 -compresslevel 5 localhost:0
2015-11-08 02:17:36	happygnu	works perfect
2015-11-08 02:17:51	Korekame	yes, but my firewall will refuse the connection across network bounds to the other machines as they are not on the same subnet, this is by design, so the laptop has to be on the same switch as the servers.

2015-11-08 02:18:14	happygnu	forward port ?
2015-11-08 02:18:17	Korekame	anyway, it's a cheap little $200 USD laptop
2015-11-08 02:18:55	Korekame	happygnu, I could forward the port, but the whole point of this is to not open holes in my security to allow for it. I don't want to make paths where hackers can jump the network bounds
2015-11-08 02:19:09	Korekame	the port forward is purposely not there
2015-11-08 02:19:34	Korekame	it's called risk mitigation
2015-11-08 02:20:02	happygnu	...I have a more "keep updated and good password" approach
2015-11-08 02:20:18	Korekame	happygnu, I do that as well
2015-11-08 02:20:28	happygnu	and backups weekly when I'm off the net :D
2015-11-08 02:20:37	Korekame	I'm a network security professional, so I'm a bit more paranoid than your average nerd

2015-11-08 02:21:25	&Allan	happygnu: freebsd has nvidia, and intel up to ivy bridge (haswell soon), and some ATI (I forget to what point). Steam for windows runs very well under wine, but steam for linux requires some newer linux features that have not been ported to the FreeBSD Linux Emulation layer yet
2015-11-08 02:21:32	happygnu	I am ready to reinstall often - but I am not attacked
2015-11-08 02:21:42	Korekame	anyway, the only time I'll be back there is during emergencies, and monthly maintenance
2015-11-08 02:21:59	Korekame	no, tor really isn't all that secure, seeing as the feds control the majority of exit nodes now.
2015-11-08 02:22:38	happygnu	and nodes being to few...
2015-11-08 02:22:39	Korekame	luckily, there are many other options out there.
2015-11-08 02:22:59	happygnu	*too
2015-11-08 02:23:30	renegadevi	yeah, I've not been a user of Tor at all, I have always thought it could be a node/proxy or whatever that's doing hidden stuff you're not aware of. 
2015-11-08 02:23:35	happygnu	my isp has dynamic ip - helps a little with anonimity
2015-11-08 02:23:51	Korekame	in any case, the server side also hosts my VPN entry point for managing my customers machines, I really don't want that network talking to any of my personal equipment because who knows what hell they've been infected with.
2015-11-08 02:23:51	renegadevi	I use VPN tho, but that's for different reasons

2015-11-08 02:25:13	Korekame	I actually have two VPN's, one for personal, one for customers. I can map into the VPN into the backend, but I choose not too.

2015-11-08 02:26:07	Korekame	see, it saves me money to be able to just remote into the customers network, rather than expending the gas to drive to location. It also allows me to monitor their systems in real time for potential threats or problemms.
2015-11-08 02:27:07	Korekame	when you take all the factors into account, my setup makes a lot more sense.

2015-11-08 02:29:02	Korekame	that's because most people have no clue about security, they know what it is, but they have no concept on how to go about it.
2015-11-08 02:30:12	Korekame	who here remembers the self-retweeting tweet bug in tweetdeck? Goes to show, even major companies mess up
2015-11-08 02:32:17	renegadevi	these days it's more the smaller obvious misstakes that becomes the big security thrreats.

2015-11-08 17:58:08	dacresni	I'm considering using btrfs home, is there any dissadvantages of using btrfs accross volumes of differing speeds?

2015-11-08 18:03:00	dacresni	wait wat?
2015-11-08 18:03:25	paperd	if you want raid on home, then your slowest drive will still effect it, sometimes.
2015-11-08 18:03:58	dacresni	no, i get this
2015-11-08 18:04:24	dacresni	it's eks , waddday mean btrfs is no good now?

2015-11-08 18:05:12	dacresni	thanks for the warrning
2015-11-08 18:05:19	eks	dacresni Chris had a few rants about btrfs on LAS
2015-11-08 18:05:26	dacresni	yah, i remember
2015-11-08 18:05:46	dacresni	minus xfs the rest, I beleive all have equil failure raits

2015-11-08 18:05:49	eks	paperd right you should, but Id never expect kernel update to ruin my fs
2015-11-08 18:06:07	dacresni	I even agreed when chris made that argument
2015-11-08 18:06:13	paperd	that seems silly...
2015-11-08 18:06:14	mjayk	are there any alternatives to btrfs on linux that offer similar functionality ? 
2015-11-08 18:06:22	dacresni	zfs
2015-11-08 18:06:23	paperd	kernel update could ruin everything
2015-11-08 18:06:41	eks	mjayk zfs but then its a different story
2015-11-08 18:06:47	dacresni	doesn't fedora do kernel updates?
2015-11-08 18:06:58	dacresni	i got a good backup thing going
2015-11-08 18:07:04	dacresni	and I wanted to use snapshots
2015-11-08 18:07:11	mjayk	zfs is newer to me so i kinda avoided it. But ill do some reading.
2015-11-08 18:07:17	dacresni	I"m looking to see if DNF will support btrfs snapshots
2015-11-08 18:07:21	paperd	zfs is actually quite easy to use
2015-11-08 18:07:24	dacresni	zfs is older in general
2015-11-08 18:07:30	paperd	the commands are not complicated at all
2015-11-08 18:07:49	paperd	dacresni: look and see if fedora has snapper
2015-11-08 18:07:49	mjayk	dacresni: i ment in a linux sense, or am i wrong there?
2015-11-08 18:08:16	eks	zfs is my favorite for now
2015-11-08 18:08:22	paperd	mjayk: I'd use zfs for /home before I'd use btrfs
2015-11-08 18:08:48	&q5sys	bfs FTW
2015-11-08 18:08:51	mjayk	oh yes im not interested in any fancy filesystems for home i just use xfs or ext4

2015-11-10 07:22:43	pseudonym	openrc is default on Gentoo and it actually seems like whomever wrote the wiki wants to discourage systemd use. It's easy though... I figured it out and I'm not that bright.
2015-11-10 07:25:25	Ioangogo	Why is systemd  bad anyway

2015-11-12 16:00:15	iamikon	Kernellinux just likes to provoke the rants
2015-11-12 16:00:46	@Kernellinux	CORRECT
2015-11-12 16:01:11	Ipsi	all you need in a desktop is a window manager, a clock, system status icons (volume, wireless, etc) and dmenu or rofi
2015-11-12 16:01:23	Ipsi	anything else is clutter
2015-11-12 16:01:34	OurRoyalGabe	oooh rants
2015-11-12 16:01:35	OurRoyalGabe	my favorite
2015-11-12 16:01:50	OurRoyalGabe	Kernellinux, did you hold that mic all the way up the ascent of the tower?
2015-11-12 16:02:10	@Kernellinux	yup
2015-11-12 16:02:37	Ipsi	gnome doesn't have minimize buttons because they think that people should use workspaces better.
2015-11-12 16:02:47	Ipsi	but even the UX of their workspaces are stupid
2015-11-12 16:02:54	@Blastyr	Is the stream taking a crap for anyone else?
2015-11-12 16:03:00	Ipsi	alt-tab doesn't separate between workspaces, so it's pointless
2015-11-12 16:03:08	Ipsi	Blastyr: yep
2015-11-12 16:03:16	Cauterize	yes
2015-11-12 16:04:04	@Tyler	Ipsi: I'm not a fan of the dynamic workspaces. I prefer just having a static 2x2 grid.

2015-11-12 16:04:20	Ipsi	the dynamic workspaces are not the problem

2015-11-12 16:04:37	CM	streams down
2015-11-12 16:04:42	Ipsi	the problem is with the alt-tab implementation
2015-11-12 16:05:01	Ipsi	and you can have a static workspace setup on gnome

2015-11-12 16:06:21	Ipsi	Blastyr: that implementation is still not good
2015-11-12 16:06:23	@Blastyr	There is an option to group alt-tab by workspace in an extension that is installed by default on Ubuntu Gnome.

A Master's comes after that. Masters will often be coupled with field work and possibly research. A PhD takes it a step farther.

2015-11-13 22:40:57	+thriftyspend	what good is IoT if they can't punch through the firewall and send back all of that big data
2015-11-13 22:41:27	thebored	no no no! the answer is so simple. just requir programmers to get programming liscenses, and just have them apply for a permit to get approved by the gov. then we are all secure forever. its all pizza and blow jobs.
2015-11-13 22:41:27	+thriftyspend	of course i guess the future means ipv6 which renders firewalls unnecessary

2015-11-15 10:41:24	AvatarContinuum	Since then first thing I do in every expansion... loremaster, complete every quest in every zone nomatter what level the quest is.
2015-11-15 10:41:24	&rikai	My only complaint about the main story of ARR
2015-11-15 10:41:25	Baconator101	rikai: oh yeah I found that more interesting than the game, but it really did feel like a load of grinding
2015-11-15 10:41:50	&rikai	is that they started doing fully voiced stuff for the main story at some point
2015-11-15 10:42:05	&rikai	but they didnt go back and add it in for a large chunk of it retroactively
2015-11-15 10:42:06	AvatarContinuum	Yeah I didn't like that about ARR, I'm max level but still halfway between ARR and the expansion.
2015-11-15 10:42:09	&rikai	so that kinda sucks
2015-11-15 10:42:18	AvatarContinuum	So I might reach the new level cap before I even start the expansion :-S
2015-11-15 10:42:29	&rikai	lol
2015-11-15 10:42:31	&rikai	you shouldnt
2015-11-15 10:42:39	Baconator101	think the only MMO I could play these days would be guild wars 2
2015-11-15 10:42:41	AvatarContinuum	So it will mean less to look forward to w hile going through it, hope the storyline is good enough to keep me interested.
2015-11-15 10:43:18	AvatarContinuum	Shouldn't, but probably will. When it comes to MMOs I tend to be a little obsessive, will stop for every side quest, join every event along the way, etc.
2015-11-15 10:43:21	immovableforce	DC Universe Online had something unique in a game that really impressed me.  They successfully combined action with RPG in a way that works and feels great.  But they ruined it later 
2015-11-15 10:43:38	Helio	thriftyspend: it's actually fairly nice, I should test out this
2015-11-15 10:43:40	Baconator101	immovableforce: have you ever played tera?
2015-11-15 10:43:45	AvatarContinuum	Loved early DC Universe Online.
2015-11-15 10:43:51	AvatarContinuum	Until about level 25ish anyway.
2015-11-15 10:43:52	immovableforce	tera.. no, I've heard of it.
2015-11-15 10:44:05	AvatarContinuum	Then it started forcing me to do group quests instead of solo stuff I pefer, and I lost interest.
2015-11-15 10:44:06	Baconator101	that has some really good combat
2015-11-15 10:44:13	Helio	we're using slack at work, but there is concern that C-level management, once they hear of it, will demand that it be self hosted, because that's what C-level is good for
2015-11-15 10:44:33	Helio	making spurious demands on emotion
2015-11-15 10:45:01	immovableforce	I'll see if I can find vids of Tera ameplay.  Thanks for that tip, Baconator101
2015-11-15 10:45:19	AvatarContinuum	God this thing's going to actually reach 1000% :-|
2015-11-15 10:45:36	Baconator101	immovableforce: some of the best combat I've seen in an MMO for years
2015-11-15 10:46:30	 *	AvatarContinuum is now pondering how a game like Final fantasy XIV can launch so horribly, get pulled from the shelf, return a few years later rebuilt and be so good it's currently one of the only games to still use a subscription model.
2015-11-15 10:47:45	locust	because they had the money to essentially develop it twice
2015-11-15 10:48:04	Baconator101	AvatarContinuum: well they replaced the whole team working on it and redid everything so theres a massive investment there that square made
2015-11-15 10:48:34	&rikai	Tera is terrible. It's visually pretty, and the combat is nice, but the story is so damn flat, boring and uninteresting.
2015-11-15 10:48:40	AvatarContinuum	Yeah, I still have the email from the original boss saying he was stepping down. Amusing how fake it is, he was so fired and someone else wrote the email pretending to be him.
2015-11-15 10:48:49	&rikai	Same thing with rift
2015-11-15 10:48:54	AvatarContinuum	Not sure why I kept that, just always thought it was amusing.
2015-11-15 10:49:07	Baconator101	rikai: yeah story didn't hold me but I've come to not think of MMOs as a good way to convey a story
2015-11-15 10:49:17	&rikai	you're thinking wrong then :P
2015-11-15 10:49:30	&rikai	I've played multiple MMOs that have conveyed story quite well
2015-11-15 10:49:45	AvatarContinuum	I've found MMOs tell stories better (on average at least) than any other genre apart from RPGs.
2015-11-15 10:49:56	Baconator101	yeah but I've played so many with crap stories or poorly done ones that its left me sour
2015-11-15 10:50:23	Baconator101	essentially <censored> MMOs have scared me
2015-11-15 10:50:51	AvatarContinuum	Star Trek Online's story turned me off pretty easy.

2015-11-15 10:51:09	locust	as boring as Rift was, i actually found the random rift events pretty neat

2015-11-15 11:16:31	AvatarContinuumm	Like Diablos paragon system or WoWs upcoming Artifact system.
2015-11-15 11:17:06	AvatarContinuumm	Being able to reach max level but still continue growing pretty much indefinately is much better than just the single level cap.

2015-11-15 11:17:27	renegadevi	I think the level system in like FFX is great, with don't even have levels.

2015-11-15 11:18:47	AvatarContinuumm	Diablo kind of doesn't have a level cap. I mean your main level caps out at 70 but your paragon levels can increase indefinately, at about 500 myself but my friends over 5000.
2015-11-15 11:18:54	Baconator101	level caps mean nothing
2015-11-15 11:18:58	&rikai	You could have a level cap of 10 and i'd be fine with it as long as the story is paced out well :P
2015-11-15 11:19:05	renegadevi	And that South Park RPG, that has some redicilous low level cap as well..  
2015-11-15 11:19:21	immovableforce	The hitting a button in the right sequence to cast at the right times gameplay doesnt work for me any more.  I need hands on swings.

2015-11-15 11:20:15	renegadevi	Haha yeah diablo 2, it takes like 1-2 hours to get to lvl 70..but after lvl 90, it's like a infinity

2015-11-15 11:42:13	AvatarContinuumm	And one more... a remaster is like an enhanced port. Taking the original game and recreating parts of it while keeping the original gameplay intact. Say upgrading the graphics and music.

2015-11-15 11:46:45	AvatarContinuumm	Say you have a nice photo of someone... a remake would be repainting it from scratch. A remaster would be recreating that painting exactly as it was but in better quality, and an enhanced port would be keeping that same painitng but trying to enhance it without recreating it.
2015-11-15 11:47:01	renegadevi	I'm not against 3D as long it's good. :) But the same way FF4 on PSP vs DS has different taste depending if you like 2D or 3D

2015-11-15 11:57:33	AvatarContinuumm	I mean the first two were brilliant, sure 2 was buggy as hell... but still, how is any third game for that series supposed to match the first 2?.
2015-11-15 11:57:39	renegadevi	one of the things I like with Kotor is that like a lot of jrpgs, there is a party system :P

2015-11-15 11:58:33	AvatarContinuumm	The expectations are just too high, impossible to achieve.

2015-11-15 12:00:50	renegadevi	KOTOR2 kinda in the same way like FF12 suffered from rushed development
2015-11-15 12:01:26	AvatarContinuumm	Well, it's a lore game... so I cheated in it. Get a good machine, make yourself invincible, and drown in all the lore, story and dialog :))
2015-11-15 12:01:34	AvatarContinuumm	I never found FF12 to be too bad.
2015-11-15 12:01:35	renegadevi	What do you think about Bravely Default?
2015-11-15 12:01:35	Baconator101	renegadevi: yeah it was Obsidians first game as well so it did have a lot of issues
2015-11-15 12:01:43	AvatarContinuumm	Or maybe I wasn't looking close enough at it, lol.
2015-11-15 12:02:04	renegadevi	I personally hold FF3 very high on my top ff games thanks it's it job-ssytem... Bravely Default was like a blast from the past, in mordern form

2015-11-15 12:05:25	renegadevi	I think Assassin's Creed 4, the pirate game was a bit too long, it took me 40-50 hours to complete it.

2015-11-15 12:08:23	renegadevi	I like the AC series with it's huge amount of content, but compare to a RPG it's a bit dragged out because you do a lot of same tasks.

2015-11-15 12:30:59	immovableforce	It's hard to figure what board to get.  Often it can have more to do with the individual model than the manufacturer when comparing similarly priced boards.
2015-11-15 12:31:15	strixdio	Absolutely.
2015-11-15 12:31:30	strixdio	I need something that can deal with virtualization very well.

2015-11-15 20:47:28	eadrom	is if someone compromises your email account
2015-11-15 20:48:01	eadrom	they still need your private gpg key and password in order to read the email
2015-11-15 20:48:27	eadrom	so it's to protect people not you and not facebook from being able to read the email from your inbox
2015-11-15 20:50:24	&rikai	The way i dont have my email snooped on is to 1. be very boring
2015-11-15 20:50:27	&rikai	and 2. dont use email
2015-11-15 20:50:29	&rikai	\o/
2015-11-15 20:50:38	eadrom	lol
2015-11-15 20:51:11	eadrom	I'd file that strategy under security via obscurity :P
2015-11-15 20:51:20	xmetal	sort of the same way ... though for me 2 is not an option so i try to get the snoopers to feel sorry for me based on 1.
2015-11-15 20:51:29	eadrom	lol
2015-11-15 20:51:36	xmetal	"oh dear ... this poor guy is really THAT boring ... i will let him be" 
2015-11-15 20:53:01	eadrom	I generally lean towards wanting to keep the script kiddies and "l33t hackzors" (from russia and china and north korea, obviously) out and not really worrying about "state level actors"

2015-11-15 20:53:50	eadrom	the lengths I'd have to go through to be reasonably sure that organizations like the NSA can't read my communications, no one I want to communicate to would be willing to go through the same loops
2015-11-15 20:53:54	xmetal	my joke above, aside ...... I never have anything that interesting to say in emails
2015-11-15 20:53:56	eadrom	*hoops
2015-11-15 20:54:01	xmetal	i am not worried about it
2015-11-15 20:54:56	eadrom	xmetal, in regards to the facebook thing, it's more so that if someone compromises my email, they can't go to facebook, request a password reset, open the email facebook sent to my email, and then reset my facebook password
2015-11-15 20:55:33	eadrom	that scenario is prevented once facebook is sending the password reset link in a gpg encrypted email

2015-11-15 20:57:06	eadrom	it's not that my emails are interesting (because they are not; my emails are "boring" as well) but it's an easy way to add another layer of security that for me, isn't very much of a bother
2015-11-15 20:58:13	eadrom	It's quick and easy for me to be able to decrypt a gpg encrypted message pretty much any time and on any device

2015-11-18 19:59:23	Zerock	And I have nothing to really work on remotely, because it all kind of requires dedicated time.
2015-11-18 19:59:37	arbulus	Zerock: What sort of projects are they?
2015-11-18 19:59:43	Zerock	arbulus: LiberTI and patts-qt
2015-11-18 20:00:13	Zerock	For LiberTI it's SDL, and for patts-qt, it's complex GUI design.
2015-11-18 20:00:32	Zerock	(like database table editors that don't break everything)
2015-11-18 20:00:52	arbulus	I've heard people say good things about developing with qt, that it's much easier to work with than gtk
2015-11-18 20:01:21	Zerock	PyQt is nice. I didn't much like it in C++. Plus, there's also the fact that it's C++.
2015-11-18 20:01:41	arbulus	lol
2015-11-18 20:01:49	Zerock	I remember when I used to defend C++.

2015-11-18 20:01:58	arbulus	One of these days I'm going to learn C++
2015-11-18 20:02:08	arbulus	I used to know some, years ago. 
2015-11-18 20:02:14	+JBot	@Angerz: They fell asleep holding hands ❤️ https://t.co/2o5VxVkjSa (1 minute 19 seconds ago)
2015-11-18 20:02:31	Zerock	arbulus: It's something just to say you know it. In practice, I'd rather just do C if I care about speed and Python if I care about high-level thinking.
2015-11-18 20:03:08	arbulus	It seems like it's a popular language to know. So many development jobs list C and C++ as requirements
2015-11-18 20:03:12	Zerock	C++ is also the Arduino language, though, so I guess it's helpful for that, but most C++ features are not used.
2015-11-18 20:03:35	Strengths	I look at that photo and hope, that to incest this is not a slippery slope
2015-11-18 20:03:37	Zerock	One writes very C-like C++ code for the Arduino.
2015-11-18 20:03:37	arbulus	Zerock: Yeah, When ever I've looked at arduino, it always just looks like straight c
2015-11-18 20:04:04	Zerock	arbulus: Look at a lot of Arduino libraries, and they are classes.
2015-11-18 20:04:22	Zerock	In fact, the official Arduino library tutorial has you implement a class.
2015-11-18 20:04:51	arbulus	C++ was the second language I ever learned. The first, surprisingly, was fortran. My sophomore high school programming class used Fortran 90. It was not fun. The next year they moved to C++. That was more pleasant. 
2015-11-18 20:05:22	Zerock	That's terrible.
2015-11-18 20:05:29	arbulus	i know
2015-11-18 20:05:38	Zerock	Though the PBASIC they made me write wasn't very good either.
2015-11-18 20:05:45	Zerock	But that wasn't a programming class.
2015-11-18 20:07:35	arbulus	Honestly, it wasn't that shocking, given the area where I grew up. I lived not far from Oak Ridge, TN, so there were a large number of scientists working there, and Fortran is big in science. So that's probably why they used it. It still feels incredibly backward though. There are so many better languages they could have taught. 
2015-11-18 20:08:04	Zerock	I'm trying to get my university to offer COBOL while I'm there.
2015-11-18 20:08:11	Zerock	Because I hate VB and already know Java.
2015-11-18 20:08:19	arbulus	That would actually be awesome. 
2015-11-18 20:08:35	arbulus	There's going to be a major need for Cobol devs soon
2015-11-18 20:08:44	Zerock	Yeah, when all the current ones die.
2015-11-18 20:08:58	Zerock	Average age of a COBOL programmer is over 50.

2015-11-18 20:11:32	arbulus	interesting
2015-11-18 20:12:24	arbulus	it's a very interesting looking language. I'm looking at code examples on wikipedia

2015-11-18 20:12:39	Zerock	arbulus: Lots of languages are doing that, now, especially in the GNU world. Writing your own compiler sucks. Easier to piggyback on C.
2015-11-18 20:12:52	Zerock	arbulus: Vala is built on gobject, which is C.
2015-11-18 20:13:08	Zerock	Vala is really less of its own language and more of a nice wrapper around gobject.
2015-11-18 20:13:08	arbulus	seems like everything is built on gobject these days
2015-11-18 20:13:26	Zerock	I actually hate gobject.
2015-11-18 20:13:32	Zerock	So much boilerplate.
2015-11-18 20:13:34	Zerock	But Vala is nice.
2015-11-18 20:13:59	Zerock	Maybe that's what I should write my game server in.
2015-11-18 20:14:02	Zerock	Hmm.
2015-11-18 20:14:18	Zerock	Or the level editor, since GTK+ is built into Vala.
2015-11-18 20:14:43	Zerock	Okay, I need sleep.

2015-11-19 18:55:39	BluPhenix316	i'm still tempted to go with Mint
2015-11-19 18:56:03	BluPhenix316	i like Arch but i like stability more, i don't have much free time as i use too
2015-11-19 18:56:14	BluPhenix316	and i like to be able to go to my computer and things just work
2015-11-19 18:56:17	woodjrx	BluPhenix316: You're exactly where I was a couple months ago
2015-11-19 18:56:59	woodjrx	BluPhenix316: I ended up going with UbuntuMate for all my machines except my c720 (arch on that).  Installed landscape, and now I can keep everything up to date easily
2015-11-19 18:57:00	BluPhenix316	woodjrx: i love Arch, and before i had free time bugs weren't a big deal
2015-11-19 18:57:29	woodjrx	BluPhenix316: Same here - on the c720, it's the only real option, though... too much edge hardware, and too low of resources
2015-11-19 18:57:30	BluPhenix316	woodjrx: my problem with Ubuntu MATE, is i like GNOME Shell
2015-11-19 18:57:42	arbulus	I wish there were a balance between surfing the edge with arch (though I can't say I've ever had too many problems with it), and stale packages. Like halfway between ubuntu and arch in terms of freshness. rolling, but not super breakbale. 
2015-11-19 18:57:46	woodjrx	BluPhenix316: hahaha, Yeah.... I can't stand it!

2015-11-19 18:58:59	woodjrx	Is Ubuntu's gnome that bad?  I mean, MATE has so many solid configurations, installing MATE and then just changing desktops could be an option?

2015-11-20 19:46:45	arbulus	I have to say, I prefered Odo's makeup in ST:DS9 S1, to later seasons. He seemed exotic in S1, and just like an angry burn victim in later seasons. An interesting difference to the typical flow of ST stories. After S3, things typically seem to really solidify. But Odo, as a character, was always kind of a mess.
2015-11-20 19:47:24	ColonelPanic	If Washington is run by corporations, which it is, there's no way encryption will be allowed to be backdoored

2015-11-22 10:47:25	LibertyHawk	I hate Icon view.  Always been a list fan myself.

2015-11-22 10:49:01	@Tyler	With the GTK file picker I'm having to rely on the preview panel and clicking every single file if I don't know the specific file name, whereas with an icon/grid view I can just look at the icon thumbnail and know it's the image I want.

2015-11-22 13:41:47	Zerock	It does not go backwards.
2015-11-22 13:41:53	arbulus	ah
2015-11-22 13:41:56	arbulus	i can see that 
2015-11-22 13:41:57	Zerock	This is a single-linked list. It can only go one way.
2015-11-22 13:42:23	Zerock	It goes forward and frees where it came from (stored externally in `current`)
2015-11-22 13:43:15	arbulus	What my goal was is to make it go to the end of the list, free the last node, then do that same thing over again until there are no nodes left to free.
2015-11-22 13:43:42	Zerock	arbulus: One more thing which is entirely up to your discretion: NULL will resolve to false if you check it as a condition, so you can use "while (first)" instead of "while (first != NULL)" if you want. Depends on how verbose you like things.
2015-11-22 13:43:56	Zerock	arbulus: Well, that's not what you did. :P
2015-11-22 13:44:01	arbulus	lol
2015-11-22 13:44:05	Zerock	arbulus: But if you did that, it would be inefficient.
2015-11-22 13:44:12	arbulus	hm
2015-11-22 13:44:14	Zerock	Having to reiterate over and over.
2015-11-22 13:44:20	Zerock	Much better to do it the way you have it.
2015-11-22 13:44:32	+thriftyspend	better how?
2015-11-22 13:44:36	Zerock	Faster.
2015-11-22 13:44:49	+thriftyspend	but what about cpu utilization?
2015-11-22 13:45:01	+thriftyspend	lines of code?
2015-11-22 13:45:04	Zerock	At the cost of (sizeof (void *)) bytes of memory.
2015-11-22 13:45:08	+thriftyspend	buffer integrity?
2015-11-22 13:45:21	Zerock	thriftyspend: Are you just pulling buzz words out of your rear? :P
2015-11-22 13:45:23	+thriftyspend	C great language or greatest language?
2015-11-22 13:45:29	arbulus	But it's webscale
2015-11-22 13:45:38	Zerock	arbulus: Nobody understands the cloud.
2015-11-22 13:46:18	+thriftyspend	no, the people that say cloud 10 time in a meeting don't understand cloud
2015-11-22 13:46:19	Zerock	arbulus: I get to convert one of my single linked lists into a double. /sigh
2015-11-22 13:46:55	Zerock	thriftyspend: Do they understand it if they only say it 9 times?
2015-11-22 13:46:59	+thriftyspend	cloud is a comfort blanket that makes them feel smart when they actually have no idea what the fsck they are saying

2015-11-24 14:40:45	Zerock	johnnyk: Standards are unicorns, yes. However, since this browser is new, it has pressure to meet standards and be compatible with existing code. It would need immense popularity to have a say in how code is written for it, so when something is incompatible, it is more likely that the browser will be patched than for you to have to change your web site.

2015-11-24 19:18:46	@Tyler	Korekame: Oh look at Mr. Fancy pants with his 4 day weekend. Sure, I've got Thanksgiving off, but the day after I've got to get right back to it... and it's nothing but insanity.

2015-11-24 19:19:41	Korekame	Tyler, I'm sorry, you should have a four day weekend as well.
2015-11-24 19:20:06	Korekame	if I was your employer, i'd give you the extra day... I'd even pay you as if you were working.
2015-11-24 19:21:44	@Tyler	Korekame: Well, gotta make sure people get their orders.
2015-11-24 19:22:12	Korekame	there's no shipping on thanksgiving weekend.

2015-11-24 19:23:25	@Tyler	Korekame: oh believe me UPS and FedEx employees are still working on black friday. I used to work for UPS. And same goes for Amazon, including the warehouse I work at.

2015-11-26 17:30:07	renegadevi	The only benefit I saw with Cinnamon was more widgets in the panels etc. compare to MATE.. but cinnamon was not wirth it when it comes down to stability or resource efficient. 
2015-11-26 17:30:32	eks	Allan lets say you dont a snapshot and you erased a wrong file, how hard is it to recover ?
2015-11-26 17:30:51	eks	renegadevi have you tried 2.8 ?
2015-11-26 17:31:08	&Allan	eks: quite hard. this is why on PCBSD you can configure it to automatically take a snapshot every 15 minutes or something. and then delete them (except the ones at the top of the hour) after 6 hours
2015-11-26 17:31:08	&Allan	etc
2015-11-26 17:31:18	&Allan	so you always have the snapshot
2015-11-26 17:31:24	renegadevi	not sure about that one^ what is the features you really need?
2015-11-26 17:31:29	&Allan	otherwise: it is forensic recovery, just like with any modern file system

2015-11-26 19:49:43	+GammalSokk	and why would I need fat pockets for solaris?
2015-11-26 19:53:30	ColonelPanic	because you're going to need support
2015-11-26 19:53:40	+GammalSokk	hehe
2015-11-26 19:54:39	ColonelPanic	omnios gud, freebsd gud
2015-11-26 19:54:47	ColonelPanic	kinda hard to choose :S
2015-11-26 19:55:10	ColonelPanic	I'd say FreeBSD is easier to set up
2015-11-26 19:55:19	ColonelPanic	FreeNAS easiest
2015-11-26 19:56:23	+GammalSokk	how is FreeBSD/FreeNAS on iSCSI performance now compared to Solaris based solutions that tend to use comstar?
2015-11-26 19:56:56	ColonelPanic	my unscientific position is "good enough"
2015-11-26 19:57:27	+GammalSokk	hehe
2015-11-26 20:00:20	+GammalSokk	Tried the Community version of Nexenta CE 4.0 but it was a nightmare on perfomance... everything was sluggish... on a dual Xeon L5520 with 48GB RAM...

2015-11-29 21:11:11	arbulus	I know one can define multiple variables on one line, e.g. int i, j, k; i think I was getting confused that if one did something like int i, j = 0; then you would be setting both i and j to 0. but in that case, you're leaving i uninitialized and seeting j to 0. correct?

At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it.

2015-11-29 21:20:29	@iamikon	yes you can hack it into rolling but it doesn't come that way
2015-11-29 21:20:44	arbulus	Debian Sid, Arch, openSuse Tumbleweed, Fedora Rawhide, Gentoo. Each give you different options depending on your preferences.

2015-12-01 17:54:01	vince	thriftyspend, If you have no idealogical reason to not go with Ubuntu derivatives, I don't know why one would choose Slackware, other than to be different.
2015-12-01 17:54:05	F41L	Just enough okay to not force me to replace it

2015-12-01 17:56:47	vince	thriftyspend, I began using Linux in highschool using Gentoo, back in the early 2000's that was where the Zealots hung out. It was like a 1-3 day process to get a working system
2015-12-01 17:57:21	F41L	I maxed out my sata ports, and added a 4 port sata card, I work in IT, and do PC repair. So I use my linux work PC for recovering data and such a lot, repairing raid arrays, the usual.

2015-12-02 10:15:48	strixdio	I never knew how much depth there was for zfs.
2015-12-02 10:15:59	Zerock|LittleRed	As an outsider, I feel like every BSD Now is about zfs.
2015-12-02 10:16:05	strixdio	Makes me feel like a chump, and like I probably have an underperforming zfs pool.

2015-12-02 10:17:37	Craig	I charge 75$ flat fee

2015-12-02 10:18:30	strixdio	Allan: Okay.
2015-12-02 10:18:45	Zerock|LittleRed	strixdio: I charge 60 per hour for any tech service, usually.
2015-12-02 10:19:04	Craig	Global settings, unless changed in each share should be good to go right?
2015-12-02 10:19:08	possnfiffer	strixdio I charge $65 to refurbish a machine - basically to figure out what's going on, save data wipe the thing and put it back together right

2015-12-02 10:19:27	&Allan	strixdio: FreeBSD, and yes
2015-12-02 10:19:32	&Allan	PCBSD for desktop
2015-12-02 10:19:58	strixdio	Okay, awesome. I've been really considering BSD for servers lately.
2015-12-02 10:20:04	possnfiffer	The PCBSD Handbook is full of useful sections
2015-12-02 10:20:07	Craig	possnfiffer - I charge 100 for a full reinstall, and data recovery is extra (the 75$)
2015-12-02 10:20:16	strixdio	I love pfsense, want it for a router. I figure, why not learn?
2015-12-02 10:20:48	Craig	I like the more strict nature of BSD, but I need practice, :p
2015-12-02 10:20:58	strixdio	heh
2015-12-02 10:21:08	possnfiffer	Craig, I usually make them spend around $165 $65 for me and $100 for a new Samsung SSD of Amazon
2015-12-02 10:21:18	Craig	Oh hehe :p
2015-12-02 10:21:24	strixdio	Now that I'm "done" with the movie, I have so many things I'm interested in learning. BSD seems like it may be more secure than linux servers. Or is it about the same?
2015-12-02 10:21:54	possnfiffer	I don't like to let people use these <censored> drives from the manufactures and think their entire system is slow
2015-12-02 10:22:32	Craig	Hey Allan, in truth, which is generally more secure? BSD, or Linux? (Like say Fedora)
2015-12-02 10:22:34	possnfiffer	I've been using Samsung SSD's since the 830 series and they just keep getting better and cheaper
2015-12-02 10:22:49	strixdio	eventually I'd love to go full SSD raidz
2015-12-02 10:22:50	Zerock|LittleRed	Craig: That's a loaded question.
2015-12-02 10:22:59	strixdio	Zerock|LittleRed: lol
2015-12-02 10:23:11	possnfiffer	This way I get to experience the new tech, without having to keep up with buying so much stuff
2015-12-02 10:23:20	Zerock|LittleRed	Craig: That's how you start fights.
2015-12-02 10:23:24	strixdio	LOL
2015-12-02 10:23:24	Craig	I was asking generally, not a specific answer
2015-12-02 10:24:00	Helio	depends on the linux distro
2015-12-02 10:24:00	&Allan	Craig: 'secure' is pretty generic, but FreeBSD comes with less untrusted software
2015-12-02 10:24:11	possnfiffer	Found out about em from a good review on AnAndTech.com Been following him since 2005, they test a lot of hardware on there
2015-12-02 10:24:18	Craig	Allan doesnt need to put his neck on the line, he is just giving his opinion, and besides, I agree with strixdio, I beleive that BSD is more secure generally.
2015-12-02 10:24:30	Helio	most linux distros have a lot of extra stuff enabled by default that increases attack surface
2015-12-02 10:24:32	Craig	See that is a good, proper, and safe answer Allan, 
2015-12-02 10:24:41	strixdio	except maybe gentoo
2015-12-02 10:24:43	Craig	gives just enough to make a statement, without bashing.
2015-12-02 10:24:51	Helio	but a 'secure' one would not
2015-12-02 10:25:19	Helio	sshd isn't enabled by default most of the time
2015-12-02 10:25:50	Helio	I think the only thing weird that freebsd enables by default is sendmail, but that is bound to 127.0.0.1 now
2015-12-02 10:26:09	Helio	I always set that to none
2015-12-02 10:26:17	Craig	Hahaha send mail is helpful if you don't mind the security warnings. :p 
2015-12-02 10:26:39	Helio	I always have the daemon off
2015-12-02 10:26:52	Helio	and you can easily replace the sendmail command to send something to logstash
2015-12-02 10:27:03	Helio	or directly ro rabbitmq, etc
2015-12-02 10:27:22	strixdio	Allan: So basically this article is just describing a default feature of ZFS?
2015-12-02 10:27:49	&Allan	strixdio: yes. mostly describing how: if you are not using ZFS, you are putting your most valuable files at risk
2015-12-02 10:27:55	strixdio	Allan: I guess I don't have to worry about sudden power outages, or if my host hard-locks?
2015-12-02 10:28:12	strixdio	(I do a lot of testing with my host)
2015-12-02 10:28:22	&Allan	correct
2015-12-02 10:28:27	&Allan	ZFS is always consistent
2015-12-02 10:28:28	strixdio	awesome! Did not know this.
2015-12-02 10:28:30	&Allan	it never needs fsck etc
2015-12-02 10:28:35	&Allan	because it is 'copy on write'
2015-12-02 10:28:42	Craig	Should you ever defrag a ZFS system?
2015-12-02 10:28:45	&Allan	if you have data being written when the power goes out, it just gets undone basically
2015-12-02 10:28:50	&Allan	Craig: there is no way to do it
2015-12-02 10:28:50	strixdio	wow.
2015-12-02 10:29:00	Craig	So why did you mention the fragmentation/
2015-12-02 10:29:01	Craig	?
2015-12-02 10:29:17	&Allan	strixdio: but unlike a normal file system, the data being written is written to a new place, not over top of the original version, so it is safe
2015-12-02 10:29:25	Helio	there is a risk in a sudden power outage to lose a pool, but it is very rare
2015-12-02 10:29:27	&Allan	Craig: it impacts performance
2015-12-02 10:29:31	Craig	Ahh
2015-12-02 10:29:38	&Allan	Helio: in what circumstance?
2015-12-02 10:29:40	Helio	and it actually requires multiple power outages in succession and read/write mounting
2015-12-02 10:30:06	Helio	Allan: the delayed free list updating in memory

2015-12-02 10:30:18	strixdio	does zfs support encryption? just wondering.
2015-12-02 10:30:22	Helio	that keeps zfs from reusing a block until 3 txgs pass
2015-12-02 10:30:33	Craig	Seriously, over lunch, when my wife is home? Rude. Just rude... :p
2015-12-02 10:30:42	&Allan	strixdio: not natively, but FreeBSD can transparently encrypt between ZFS and the disk
2015-12-02 10:30:48	strixdio	Okay.
2015-12-02 10:31:04	Helio	eventually I'll get around to figuring out all the trigger cases for it
2015-12-02 10:31:05	Craig	I was actually going to watch it today. :S
2015-12-02 10:31:37	&Allan	Helio: how would you lose the pool? shouldn't you just be able to rewind a few TXGs? (only 32 are available with 4k sectors)
2015-12-02 10:31:48	&Allan	Helio: there is talk about doing some kind of 'aging' on the txg's in the label
2015-12-02 10:32:00	Helio	Allan: the problem is only the first 3 txgs are guaranteed to have blocks that are not reused
2015-12-02 10:32:08	&Allan	so like, the last 12 or so would be grandfathered, instead of just a regular circular ring
2015-12-02 10:32:09	Helio	and that goes away on reboot
2015-12-02 10:32:21	Craig	hey Allan, is there a way to run CT's on a FreeNAS system? Or would you recommend VM's of linux?
2015-12-02 10:32:33	Craig	(I need some for web hosting and such,)
2015-12-02 10:32:34	&Allan	Craig: what is a ct?
2015-12-02 10:32:36	Helio	it copies the free list it wrote out to disk 3 txgs ago, into memory to use as the new free list
2015-12-02 10:32:42	Craig	Container in Proxmox, 
2015-12-02 10:33:00	strixdio	Craig: so like a BSD jail?
2015-12-02 10:33:03	&Allan	Craig: freebsd has jails, which are better containers. they optionally work with docker now
2015-12-02 10:33:06	Craig	Similar I would say
2015-12-02 10:33:09	Helio	but the way it interleaves txg operations also makes it hard to track
2015-12-02 10:33:10	&Allan	Craig: you can also run VMs on freebsd

2015-12-02 10:33:42	Helio	Allan: right
2015-12-02 10:33:49	Craig	So would you recommend a FreeBSD server with VM's and Containers, or FreeNAS underneth since I need the SMB shares as well.
2015-12-02 10:33:56	Helio	it shuld
2015-12-02 10:34:11	Helio	it requires changing the free list code and modifying the mounting to use the freelist from n transactions ago
2015-12-02 10:34:22	Helio	instead of the current list
2015-12-02 10:34:25	&Allan	Craig: it is easy to configure samba on top of vanilla freebsd
2015-12-02 10:34:37	Craig	Sounds like the Ubuntu of the BSD world.
2015-12-02 10:34:40	Helio	you know how that code is, tracking that down is a bit of a pain
2015-12-02 10:34:55	Helio	the code for one function can be all over the place

2015-12-02 10:42:51	strixdio	I have an issue with ZFSoL with it using a crap-ton of ram. A VM with 4GB ram winds up using something like 12-16GB ram.

2015-12-04 17:15:24	xmetal	i think part of the Mint logic ( ChrisLAS, Kernellinux) has to do with stuff like Unity 7 to Unity 8 + other changes Conical (sp?) is making 
2015-12-04 17:15:33	xmetal	thats why Clem decided to stick to LTSs

2015-12-04 17:15:51	micah68	ChrisLAS! You are driving me nuts. Canonical has been working so hard on revamping things for convergence for the past several releases.

2015-12-04 17:16:12	xmetal	Ubuntu Mate and Mint are both great ... to pick a favorite it'd be "splitting hairs" for me
2015-12-04 17:16:18	micah68	The way Chris talks about it, you'd think Canonical devs are lazy.
2015-12-04 17:16:38	Korekame	meh, I'd cut ubuntu some slack for the UI aspects not being updated with the big switch to systemd on the backend
2015-12-04 17:17:04	xmetal	I have different machines to test Distros though Ubuntu Mate / Mint are my daily drivers
2015-12-04 17:17:19	xmetal	the "if i had to pick just one distro" i would use one of those two 
2015-12-04 17:17:45	mrmtampa	Canonical is juggling so many projects that Unity has fallen to the wayside, maybe unity 8 will save them.
2015-12-04 17:17:54	xmetal	even if not this week ... I wonder if Clem would come on LUP
2015-12-04 17:18:01	systemT	Mint's concern is refining DESKTOP Linux. Canonicals goals are not the same. Convergence.
2015-12-04 17:18:22	systemT	Cloud
2015-12-04 17:18:25	micah68	Canonical shouldn't waste their time doing anything heavy with Unity 7, but direct their efforts at Unity 8. Which is what they are doing.

2015-12-05 22:38:05	&Allan	lz4 is more compression, for less cpu time, than the old default (lzjb), and is now the default

2015-12-06 11:13:22	Torikun	oh
2015-12-06 11:13:26	strixdio	but the second half is that cron + user = issue.

2015-12-06 11:14:19	Torikun	The cron job is important to update the block list so you can protect yourself from the law
2015-12-06 11:14:22	strixdio	running transmission as non-root isn't an issue.
2015-12-06 11:15:00	Torikun	to get cron working as non- root, you will need to change cron job to run like su -c user -c "trans..."
2015-12-06 11:15:11	strixdio	or just chown XD

2015-12-06 21:01:55	TheAnime	it's a server
2015-12-06 21:05:56	Adam_FromVancouver	TheAnime: yup.. but the tech google uses is called "CloudPrint"
2015-12-06 21:06:23	TheAnime	ah yeah that uses a cloud
2015-12-06 21:06:54	TheAnime	idk my printers have that built in. an rpi should be fine
2015-12-06 21:07:03	TheAnime	could probably get one of the cheaper crappier ones even
2015-12-06 21:07:44	Adam_FromVancouver	seems the issue for my brother is that he doesn't have the coludprint service running on his laptop
2015-12-06 21:08:20	Adam_FromVancouver	it's a python solution that's used.. I have it running here so regular laptops can print to it
2015-12-06 21:08:51	TheAnime	so you just want something running the could print service?
2015-12-06 21:08:52	Adam_FromVancouver	then, I have a 15 year old laser printer that still has the original toner (!!) attached to my server

2015-12-06 21:09:42	Adam_FromVancouver	things are not working for him with the driver that got auto installed
2015-12-06 21:09:45	TheAnime	a model A with just a USB wifi adapter could work then
2015-12-06 21:09:47	Adam_FromVancouver	this is vanilla ubuntu unity
2015-12-06 21:10:48	TheAnime	if you're planning on picking up a pi for the job and have the spare wifi adapter, that would be pretty cheap. or a pi zero with that solution might even be cheaper! :o but good luck getting your hands on one
2015-12-06 21:11:45	TheAnime	is it entirely python? I wonder if you could get it to run on an ESP8266 :o
2015-12-06 21:11:53	TheAnime	those are like $2
2015-12-06 21:11:54	Adam_FromVancouver	ya.. I'm thinking in the new year there will be more availabel

2015-12-06 21:18:30	TheAnime	thats true it needs a power supply

2015-12-08 18:25:40	afedon	prepaid just means you are paying for service (minutes, data, etc) prior to using said service.  Most cell plans are post-paid, meaning you get a bill at the end of the month based on your plan price and any overages you may have incurred.
2015-12-08 18:25:43	dominickm	Itsme take a look at Daskeyboard
2015-12-08 18:26:10	RIBERTY	afedon so does a prepaid cell work with ting?
2015-12-08 18:27:11	afedon	It might.  I do not think the phone hardware is fundamentally different, you have are just billed a different way when on a prepaid plan.
